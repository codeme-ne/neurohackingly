I sought advice from a communications specialist with more than 35 years of experience.

## 3 Speaking Skills for effective communication

### ☝ First-person use.

Talk about your **own thoughts, feelings, desires, and needs.** Speak in the "I" form and avoid "you" statements. Avoid accusations or reproaches.

### 🥴 Communicate your feelings

Try to open up emotionally and express what is going on inside you. Express your **feelings and needs directly.**

### 🤸‍♂️ Address specific situations and behavior

Talk about **concrete situations or behaviors.**

**Avoid generalizations** like "always" and "never." Avoid personality attributions like "typical" and character traits. Stay in the present moment.

* * *

Many people already know at least one of the 3 speaking skills.  
But do you use them regularly? ♻

**Have you read part one yet?**
