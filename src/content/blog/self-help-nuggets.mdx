### 🗨️ Favourite Quotes from the book: [The Science of Self-Discipline](https://www.amazon.com/Science-Self-Discipline-Willpower-Self-Control-Temptation/dp/197905116X) by Peter Hollins on [Shortform](https://www.shortform.com/?utm_source=neurohackingly&utm_medium=partner)

> "**Discipline** is the willpower to **resist things you desire in the short term** in order to promote what’s **best for you in the long term**."

> "**Motivation** is complementary to discipline because it can be a catalyst for setting a goal and even inspire some action toward that goal, but it’s **short-lived**"

> "One possibility is that intrinsic **motivation may form after you perform a habit over time.** For example, you don’t like regularly reading for a history class in college, but you eventually develop an interest in Ancient Rome that drives your reading habits in that subject."

> "Develop Discipline Like It’s a Muscle, Hollins explains that just like any part of your body you would train to improve, **your brain can become more proficient at maintaining discipline through practice.**"

> "On the other hand, **giving into temptation weakens these pathways in your prefrontal cortex, making self-gratifying behaviors more habitual**."

### 🟡🔵🔴🟢 The book: [Feel Good Productivity](https://www.feelgoodproductivity.com/) by Ali Abdaal

I am currently listening to the Audiobook of Feel Good Productivity.

Summary so far: Prioritize self-care, and success will follow.

Not the other way around. 

* * *

### 💡 Learning: Don't wait till the environment is set up perfectly to get in a productive work session.

I experienced the best flow moments:

Driving in a crowded Flixbus.

Sitting in a small busy cafe.

Waiting for 30 minutes in the cold.

### 📝 I completed the Past Year Reflection (PYR) by Tim Ferriss and experienced great insights

Look at the instructions in [last week's newsletter edition.](/little-treasure-trove/)

_"What 20% of each column produced the most reliable or powerful peaks?"_

If you are interested in my answers: 

**Positive:**

*   Thankfulness Journal
*   Being Honest
*   Daytrips (e.g. Hallstatt, Austria)
*   Movement of any kind
*   Friends
*   NLP-Coaching
*   [Oura Ring](/oura-ring-3-review/) (health)

**Negative:**

*   Always wanting more
*   Being sloppy (admin tasks)
*   Taking no Break, especially working in the evening
*   Over-optimisation
*   Spending money on unnecessary things

* * *

### 🧘 Practicing Equanimity in ~5°C (41°F) cold water @2000m in Tyrol, Austria

I went skiing for the first time this year. 

Thereafter I took a relaxing ice bath. 

Here's the proof.
