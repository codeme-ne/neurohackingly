Like any other skill I wanted to master in the past, I decided to sign up for a cohort-based course. I want to learn how to write online, so I signed up for Ship 30 for 30, hosted by Dickie Bush & Nicolas Cole.

## Here are 3 reasons why I sign up for a Cohort-Based Course when learning a new skill

### ⏲It saves a lot of time.

I don't have to **search through all the information there is out there**, on the skill I want to learn. I get it served on a silver tablet. Then I just have to filter out what works for me and put it into action.

### 💃🏼 The atmosphere is great.

Of all the cohorts I've attended so far, **the vibe, support, and atmosphere have always been insane.** It's not work. It's not school. 99% of the participants are here by choice and are highly motivated. This leads to so much support and growth.

### 💯 You will learn what you want to learn. And more.

Yes, Ship 30 for 30 teaches you how to write online. But I bet like in all of the other courses I have done so far, I will learn so much more. The knowledge you gain in one course you can thus **apply to other areas of your life.**

Over the next 30 days, I plan on writing about [mindset](/mindset/), [seeking discomfort](/31daychallenge/), and [tech.](/tech/)

I'm excited to start sharing what I know online, now also on Twitter.
