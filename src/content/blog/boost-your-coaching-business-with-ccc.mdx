👋 Hello Friend

Are you founding your own coaching business or planning to work as a coach in the future?

Do you often feel alone and unsure of what to do next?

Overwhelmed by where to start with so many tasks piling up?

Are you lacking the accountability needed to consistently work on your business?

**Join the CourageousCoachesClub**—a community where you can connect with other coaches who are in the early stages of their coaching business.

In our weekly workshops, you will receive practical tips that you can apply directly to your coaching business. Additionally, once a month, an experienced coach will join us to share their journey, giving you the opportunity to ask questions and gain insights.

**Who is the CourageousCoachesClub for?**

This club is for aspiring or experienced coaches who are eager to learn more about building their coaching business and achieving measurable progress.

**What does the CourageousCoachesClub include?**

*   **Monthly Meetings:** We meet four times a month to discuss our businesses.
*   **Science-based Content:** I present content focused on coaching startups, providing valuable and practical information that you can immediately implement.
*   **Community & Networking:** After each session, we host an open virtual roundtable for engaging with like-minded individuals.

**What will change after I become a member of CCC?**

You will gain clarity on how to proceed with your coaching business, opportunities for collaboration with other coaches, renewed focus and drive, insights and potential breakthroughs, and a sense of community, realizing that you are not alone in your struggles.

**Who is behind CCC?**

Hello, my name is Lukas. I transitioned from being an airline pilot to founding a coaching business.

During the planning phase, I experienced the loneliness that solo entrepreneurship can bring. Fortunately, I had top business coaches by my side and could leverage my knowledge from my business informatics studies. However, I missed exchanging ideas with other young entrepreneurs facing similar challenges.

**What does CCC cost?**

The regular membership is priced at 249 Euros per month.

Act quickly and secure a 100 Euro discount as one of the first 10 participants, getting the premium membership for just 149 Euros per month, which is less than 37.5 Euros per week. Think about the value of receiving guidance from coaches who have faced the exact challenges you encounter.

How about learning their solutions to these problems?

**Not satisfied?**

This community is currently in the beta phase. If you are not satisfied, simply write to me with your feedback, and I will refund the full amount.

**Learn More** If you're eager to enhance your coaching business, contact me at lukaszangerl@neurohackingly.com, and I will guide you on how to proceed.

Have a great week!

Lukas
