👋 Hey friend

This is definitely a newsletter you'll want to save for those times when you're chilling on the sofa on a Sunday evening or taking the train to work.

I was a bit bored this week and read through Ali Abdaal's newsletter and posts. In doing so, I came across some helpful pages and wanted to share them with you. Have fun browsing. 🧑‍💻

#1.❓ Great [interactive questions](https://programs.clearerthinking.org/lcq.html#.Xnfw-y2cbO0) about life to reflect on.
