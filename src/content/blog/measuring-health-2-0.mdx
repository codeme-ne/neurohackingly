👋 Hello friend

Today, I’ll give you an insight into my current health data, measured with Sceneca at [IceSpa Düsseldorf](https://icespa-duesseldorf.de/).

I routinely measure my body parameters every 2 months with Seneca. In the last newsletter [Measuring Health 1.0](/measuring-health/), I wrote about my goals.

### These were my Goals, 2-3 months ago (in descending priority)

1.  Improve posture, especially in the neck area
2.  Reduce body fat to 15%
3.  Balance alignment

### Actual Results After 2 Months

1.  **Posture**: Slight improvement in head alignment (noticeable at the nose).

3.  **Balance**: Health professionals confirmed that a 1.3 cm difference between shoulders is within the normal range and does not require action.

### My Strategies to better my Posture and reduce Body Fat

#### Posture Strategies

> "The alignment of your head, neck, and shoulders can significantly impact the drainage of blood from your brain, influencing your overall well-being." - DOI: [10.4103/bc.bc\_25\_18](https://journals.lww.com/brci/fulltext/2019/05010/increase_in_cerebral_blood_flow_indicated_by.4.aspx)

**🦕 Lengthen Your Spine with Visualization**

1.  Imagine a string pulling your spine straight up.
2.  Focus on lengthening through the back of your neck.
3.  Keep your chin slightly tucked.
4.  Pull your shoulders down and back.
5.  Keep your chest open and pelvis neutral.
6.  Distribute your weight evenly between both feet.

**🏃‍♀️ Boost Circulation and Focus with Movement Breaks**

_Try these movements:_

*   Roll your shoulders backward.
*   Stand up and reach your arms overhead.
*   Gentle spinal twists in your chair.
*   Lean your head side to side slowly.
*   Take a short walk or do some lunges.
*   Perform a few standing backbends.

**☎️ Practice Proper Phone Ergonomics**

*   Hold your phone up in front of your face.
*   Keep your head aligned over your shoulders.
*   Maintain a straight spine.

#### **Body Fat Reduction Strategies**

*   HIIT training 10 minutes: Monday, Wednesday, Friday
*   Daily 30-minute morning workout

### Goals for June 27, 2024
