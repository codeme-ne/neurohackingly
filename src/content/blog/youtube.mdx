## 🎬 My YouTube Channel

I enjoy making short and informative episodes about **studying, productivity and self-development.**

As a continuous learner, I want to pass on well-researched information you can practically integrate into your own life. Like [my podcast](/podcast/), the episodes are short and to the point.

For the best learning experience, feel free to watch [my videos on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCOPBNUSX_4Z7l2Qc-FYMS3g/videos) and if you like them, maybe even like and subscribe. 🌱
