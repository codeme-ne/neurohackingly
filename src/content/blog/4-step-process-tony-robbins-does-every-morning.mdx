Have you ever experienced this?

You are thinking about buying a new thing, let it be a car. 🚗 Suddenly everywhere you look, you only see this specific model you are considering buying.

**Your focus has shifted.** 🎯

<GifVideo alt="Sherlock trying to focus while touching his head" webm="/images/4-step-process-tony-robbins-does-every-morning/leave-me.webm" mp4="/images/4-step-process-tony-robbins-does-every-morning/leave-me.mp4" poster="/images/4-step-process-tony-robbins-does-every-morning/leave-me.jpg" />

Tony Robbins says that we can actively control what our brain focuses on. With as little as 10 minutes he sets the tone for the day.

**You will experience mood, energy, and performance benefits. 💪**

## Priming: A simple 10-minute, 4-step process to have a fantastic day

The simple 10-minute, 4-step process consists of a special **breathing exercise**, followed by experiencing once more **3 events you are grateful for**. (It can be something as little as the chair you are sitting on.) Thereafter you imagine **light cleansing your body.**

🕯 Finally, you step into a future situation when **having achieved your goal** and celebrate it. 🎉

## If you are at all interested in learning about Priming, here are the 4 reasons why I do it:

1.  **Problems become challenges.**  
    One day I accepted the feeling of being nervous before a meeting and thought to myself that I can learn from it. (as corny as it sounds)
2.  **I appreciate the little things.**  
    I notice a bug walking across the sidewalk. Life looks more colorful.
3.  **I focus more on others, and less on myself.**  
    I listen actively and focus less on consuming and more on giving.
4.  **I noticed more positive self-talk.**  
    I can take a step back mentally and think before reacting.

If you want to take a look or even try out Tony Robbin's priming routine, you can look at [this Youtube Video.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=faTGTgid8Uc) 🎬
