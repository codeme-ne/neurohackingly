Hello friends 👋

  
Lately I have noticed that **often** **the non-intuitive things are the best to do**. When I'm stuck on a problem and don't know how to move forward, my intuition tells me: "Keep going Lukas". That's a great approach to stress yourself, trying to reach a goal tensely and at the same time reducing your own room for maneuver.

An experienced pilot once told me when being confronted with a problem in the airplane (which does not require immediate attention) he first moves back his chair and gets a coffee. What is he trying to tell me?

Often it is more useful to **take a step back from the situation and let your subconscious work**. If we ask ourselves the right questions, our brain works up to 20 minutes on this specific question. That's why it takes some till we remember where we left our car keys when we are actually now doing something completely different than searching for our keys. Our brain still works on solving the problem by finding the keys.

Or "we sleep once over it and the problem that has occupied us until now, has partially "solved itself" overnight.Also, longer timeouts are quite helpful to charge one's batteries again. I am enjoying the last days in Rhodes and already plan to do a 10-day [Vipassana meditation retreat](https://www.dhamma.org/en/index) in November.  

Have a great week!  

xx Lukas

James Allen writes about the power of thought in his 80-page classic. "Easy to read and good to follow along with the simple methods he teaches"

> If you get distracted or start procrastinating, don’t freak out and downward spiral; just gently come back to your ONE to-do.
