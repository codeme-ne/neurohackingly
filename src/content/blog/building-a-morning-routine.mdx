There are a lot of books about building a perfect morning routine.

And I've read most of them.

But the **best book on building a perfect morning routine** is [The Miracle Moring by Hal Elrod.](https://amzn.to/3qRlrtM)

## The Miracle Morning consists of the following six steps

**🧘‍♀️ Step #1:** **Stillness** (5min) meditate, practice Wim-Hof breathing, deep breathing, and gratitude (choose one or combine them.)

**🗯 Step #2:** **Affirmations** (5 min): Either write your affirmations or listen to [spoken ones](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maNr_0zK5VQ&t=3s).

**💭 Step #3:** **Visualization** (5 min) Your brain can't distinguish between something happening right now or just vividly imagining.

Use this to **visualize that you have already achieved your goals.**

Achieve the maximum effect by:

*   Shouting it out loud,
*   throwing your arms into the air,
*   and playing full out.

**🏋️‍♂️ Step#4:** **Exercise** (20 minutes). Do some form of movement. If you are in a hurry, do the [7-minute workout](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mmq5zZfmIws).

**📖 Step #5:** **Reading** (20 min) Read ten pages in a book that helps develop yourself further. _Apply_ what you have read today.

**✍ Step #6:** **Scribing** (5 min) Write in your journal. Or try the [Winners Journal.](https://www.thewinnersjournal.com/)

* * *

**Step #6 Journaling questions:**

*   _What kind of person do I want to be today?_
*   _Even if everything goes wrong, I will be happy when I have achieved/done this one thing:_
*   _What good thing will I do for myself today? (massage, sauna, sports, etc.)_
*   _What am I especially looking forward to today?_
*   _How can I make things I don't feel like doing today a game?_

#### Summary

The order and time of each step can be varied.

If you want to build a morning routine, **I can't recommend [**this book**](https://amzn.to/3qRlrtM) enough.**

(And if you've read it, do you agree? What other book would you recommend for beginners?)
