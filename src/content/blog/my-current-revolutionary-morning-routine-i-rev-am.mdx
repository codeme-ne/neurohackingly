👋 Hello friend 

I have already tried many different Morning Routines.

Blogpost: [6 miracle morning hacks to have more energy throughout the day](/6-hacks-for-a-miracle-morning-routine/)

Blogpost: [This Is The Best Book I’ve Ever Read On Building A Perfect Morning Routine](/building-a-morning-routine/)

Podcast Episode: [My Productive Morning Routine](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1flfMEqXjoRRWHx01dJ6QA?si=tCwp68FTTzC-D_BQCcTWBg)

## My current morning routine consists of the following acronym: I REV AM

### 🦸‍♂️I: Identity (5 minutes)

This stands for the identity I am trying to become in 3 areas of my life: Health, Wealth & Relationships. I wrote about it in a past newsletter [Peak Performance Program.](/peak-performance-program-2/)

### 🤓R: Reading (20 minutes)

For reading I use my all time favourite reading app Shortform. I am currently getting deeper into the topic of relationships by reading No More Mr. Nice Guy By Robert Glover. Get a _20% discount_ on Shortform's annual subscription with the link [shortform.com/neurohackingly](https://www.shortform.com/?utm_source=neurohackingly&utm_medium=partner).

### 💪🏼E: Exercise (20 - 45 minutes)

I exercise for max. 45 minutes per day following the [Bryan Johnson Longevity Workout Routine](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1J9vENr-nTnyiCze-Zcjycc8Aoh48OSGUKru8RE__LB0/edit?usp=sharing) (selfmade google doc). I have seen some improvements in my posture which really excites me. 🎉

### 🔮V: Visualize (5 minutes)

I visualize my day with the guided [Best Possible Future Self Exercise](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_jEsnDEIa0) on Youtube. This is where I go through my day and imagine what I want to accomplish today (written down in the Identity section above) and which challenges might come up and how I plan to react to them today.

### 🗣️A: Affirmations (5 minutes)

I currently have the habit of doing affirmations.

I don't just say "I am strong" or affirmations that I might not really believe myself. I first ask myself what kind of person I want to be, or what qualities and behaviors I need to possess in order to be able to master future situations. I then adapt my affirmations accordingly.

> "[...] affirmations alone cannot change a person. However, Glover says they help reinforce productive habits and combat negative thoughts. [...] while listening to positive affirmations may help boost your mood, reading them may lead to unproductive self-reflection." - Shortform, No More Mr. Nice Guy, Robert Glover

### 🧘‍♀️M: Meditation (10 minutes)

10 Minutes Anapana Meditation.

**Summary:** My morning routine includes a short reflection exercise to put on my best identities, learning new things through reading, exercising, even if it's only briefly, visualizing my ideal day and finding stillness in meditation.

💡

You don't have to integrate all the components into your morning routine. If you have limited time in the morning you could ask yourself: __What are 20% of the things I should have as a morning routine to achieve 80% of my desired results?__

What does your morning routine look like?

Have a great week! 🌞
