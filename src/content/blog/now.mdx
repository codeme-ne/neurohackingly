Update July 14th from my home in Duesseldorf Germany, where a warm summer has begun.

**21-day AI youtube challenge**  
I'm currently doing a [21-day YouTube challenge](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7800kYv33I&list=PLblQ_auC0pm8E9Hhq7ngjzq31KnoVx3B3) where I post one video every day about using AI in daily life. 2 videos down, 19 to go! For this personal project, quantity beats quality - but I still make sure each video shares at least ONE useful AI tip or real-world use case.

**fresh graduate congress ahead**  
I received my Bachelor's degree in Business Informatics a few weeks ago. Now I'm preparing for my presentation as a speaker at the last official [Landsiedel Congress in Zeilitzheim](https://www.landsiedel-seminare.de/nlp/nlp-kongress/nlp-kongress-zeilitzheim.html#:~:text=Lukas%20Zangerl%20%7C%20Meistere,Energie%2C%20die%20bleibt.).

**refining the course**  
I am currently evaluating the responses from [my 12-week productivity course](https://www.produktiv.me/pw). After each of the 12 modules, participants filled out a simple questionnaire. This helps me to constantly improve the modules.

**coding appetite growing**  
After developing an accountability app during my Bachelor's, I'm hungry to learn much more about coding. Currently working through the course at buildyourownapps.com and getting tons of inspiration from Twitter to build more apps and launch startups. This is really exciting stuff.

**september cohort launching**  
The next productivity course starts in September and I can hardly wait after the [great reviews from the last cohort](https://www.produktiv.me/rezensionen/).
