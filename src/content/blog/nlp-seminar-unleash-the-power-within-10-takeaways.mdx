## 50 Hours Of Self Help and NLP Immersion Compressed Into 10 Key Points 🚀

1.  🍀 In a [good state](/the-moment-of-excellence-experience-powerful-positive-and-passionate-feelings-at-the-push-of-a-button/), you have **goal-oriented thoughts.** Thoughts don't spiral down; they become clearer.
2.  🧭 **Don't focus on what you don't want.** Embody having achieved your goal. Be as clear and specific as possible.
3.  **🏆 Winner-Take-All Effect.** Small differences in performance lead to out-sized rewards. You win by 1%, 1 second, or 1 dollar, but **get 100% of the victory.** James Clear's Post [The 1 Percent Rule: Why a Few People Get Most of the Rewards](https://jamesclear.com/the-1-percent-rule)
4.  🎼 People process and retain **auditory information** best through their **right ear.**
5.  **⚡ Energy is life.** No energy, no habit change.
6.  ↩ If something doesn't work, **change your approach.** Disney got rejected _300 times_ by financiers for the [Mickey Mouse concept](https://www.forbes.com/sites/jamesasquith/2020/12/29/did-you-know-walt-disney-was-rejected-300-times-for-mickey-mouse-and-his-theme-park/) before he got the credit.
7.  💔 All suffering comes because we are **focusing on ourselves.**
8.  **💥** [**Prime yourself**](/4-step-process-tony-robbins-does-every-morning/), otherwise, the environment will prime you.
9.  👨‍👩‍👦‍👦 People's lifes are a direct reflection of the **expectations of their peer group.**
10.  🏃‍♂️ On May 6, 1954, after 1000 years of trial and error, Roger Bannister was the first person in the world to run one mile in under four minutes. _24 years later_, _over 200 runners ran one mile in under four minutes._  
     Because of Bannister, **their belief was changed.**
