In her bestselling book [A Mind for Numbers](https://amzn.to/3XpaXMV), the author Barbara Oakley writes about 2 modes of learning: **The focused mode and the diffused mode.**

#### The focused mode is activated when solely focusing on the task in front of you, like doing a math equation or reading a science book.

Barbara Oakley uses the metaphor of a pinball machine. The thoughts don't have any space to get information out of other parts of the brain. You are in tunnel vision and, like horses, don't see right or left.

#### The diffused mode is present when doing relaxing activities like hiking or sports. The mind wanders.

The diffused mode is useful when trying to find a solution to a difficult problem you are stuck on. In the diffused mode, you can access other areas of your brain. Suddenly you can access information you would have never thought of in the focused mode.

Going back to the pinball machine metaphor, there is more space and, thus, a way to find different solutions.

**The worst thing you can do is to try to stay focused** when you are stuck on a problem.

#### An Example of a great man using the diffused mode of thinking to his advantage to solve difficult problems

When Thomas Edison was stuck on a problem, he relaxed in his chair and dozed off with his keys in his hand. When he was about to fall asleep, his keys fell and woke him up. This was when the brain switched to the diffused mode of thinking. Most of the time, he then had the answer to his problem.

#### Things you can do to let your brain switch to the Diffused Mode

*   Sauna
*   Ice Bath
*   Hiking
*   Walking
*   Meditating
*   etc.

**How to access the Diffused Mode? Do any activity where your brain can relax and think of other things.**

Every person has their own unique way of going into diffused mode.

I love to go into the sauna or take an ice bath. Afterward, I feel how my whole brain and body reset. I have the best ideas when in the diffused mode of thinking - relaxing after a 15-minute steam sauna.

#### When I study, I try to study for about 30-45 minutes and then take a short break.

During the break, I do not allow myself to go onto my cell phone. I sometimes lay in bed for some minutes, let my mind relax, and doze off. This lets me switch from focused to diffused mode.

### Summary

There are 2 modes of thinking: the focused mode and the diffused mode.

The focused mode is essential for rational thinking, like maths and science. The diffused mode is suitable when getting stuck on a problem or creative work.
