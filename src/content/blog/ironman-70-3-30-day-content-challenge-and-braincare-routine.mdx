👋 Hello friend

In this week's newsletter edition, I have 6 things I want to share with you.

#### 💪 The 30-Day-Content-Challenge: New blog post or Podcast episode every day for 30 days

"The 10-day Vipassana meditation seminar made me realize again how powerful it is to focus on one subject area only, with full immersion." - you can [read more on this blogpost](/30-days-30-episodes/) which I dedicated to this area.

Success does not come from a secret shortcut. It comes from putting in the work repeatedly, not stopping even though results may not show (yet).

#### 🎶 Favorite song this week: [Mrs Robinson from Simon & Garfunkel](https://open.spotify.com/intl-de/track/0iOZM63lendWRTTeKhZBSC?si=b81ccb43c7284338)

Watching Forest Gump this week, I stumbled upon this classic blast.

#### 📖 Book I am currently reading: [The Motivation Myth](https://amzn.to/45kdKLF?ref=neurohackingly.com), by Jeff Haden.

Did you know that you have to put in the work first, and only then does motivation arise? Not vice versa! I didn't...

#### 💬 Favorite quote of the week:

> Now, finally, after trying many things and figuring out what to focus on and putting in enough reps, you can begin to simplify. You can trim away the fat because you know what is essential and what is unnecessary.  
> As the Frenchman Blaise Pascal famously wrote in his Provincial Letters, **“If I had more time, I would have written you a shorter letter.”**  
> Mastering the fundamentals is often the hardest and longest journey of all.- [How Experts Figure What to Focus On](https://jamesclear.com/getting-simple) via Instapaper

#### 🦸‍♂️ [Ironman 70.3](/ironman70-3-zell-am-see/) - Zell am See, Austria: 7 days to go

I am finally coming closer to my dream of running an Ironman someday. Hopefully, I can tick it off my [ImPossible List](/impossiblelist/) someday.

As mentioned in [this week's blog post](/ironman70-3-zell-am-see/), I am doing half an Ironman next week. Both mentally and physically, I am in good shape. If one of you dear readers has any experience, I would be grateful for some swimming advice. 🌊

#### 🧠 [The Ultimate Evidence-Based Braincare Routine](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2czIPRE0Nc) by Ali Abdaal  

Ali Abdaal mentions 5 Key Areas to focus on for improved cognitive function, memory, and overall brain function.

**The Fuel**: Follow a Mediterranean diet consisting of fruits, vegetables, whole grains & other plant-based foods. Don't overcomplicate things. We know what is healthy and what is not.

**Exercise the Body**: During movement, the body produces brain-derived neurotrophic factor, a molecule involved in learning and memory. The highest amount is produced when doing open-skill exercises, like badminton or soccer.

**Exercise the Mind**: You can rewire your brain by doing cognitively demanding tasks, whether by a "one mental challenge a day" routine or a passion project, like programming a personal website.

**Sleep**: Sleep is the best performance-enhancing drug. More on [Ali's evidence-based sleep routine.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3eS4jr2pIo)

**Lifestyle**: Remove negative before adding more positive things like Tim Ferris with his [Not-To-Do List.](https://tim.blog/2007/08/16/the-not-to-do-list-9-habits-to-stop-now/)
