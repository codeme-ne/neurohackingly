👋 Hello friend

Today I did the [Wim Hof Method breathing method.](/how-to-stop-overthinking/)

And what can never be missing according to the Wim Hof method? Exactly, **the good old ice bath.**

So, I so at a pleasant 15 ° C comfortably in the bathtub, (😉) when the following came to mind by the increased sensitivity due to the cold:

The process of taking an ice bath is similar to any challenge in our lives.

## The reason why some people succeed in challenges and others do not is HOW they make a decision.

I decided with **absolute certainty to** go to the ice bath. (unlike other times 😉)

Then my brain went through all the [submodalities](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sinnesmodalit%C3%A4t) like seeing, hearing and feeling:

**👀 Seeing:** As a result, images have appeared in my head of me lying down in the bathtub with only my head looking out of the water.

**🤲 Feeling:** I associated a feeling of safety with it (can't remember exactly where and what I felt in my body).

**🦻 Listening:** Also, I remembered the sentence that was told to me by a Wim Hof instructor:

"Take control."

#### The initial change is the biggest hurdle.

Like any challenge, it was hard when I put my first foot in the bathtub.

Until about 10 seconds after I was in the bathtub. After 30 seconds, 1 minute, 2 minutes, I didn't want to get out of the water. **The 15°C became my new standard.**

## The images/thoughts/feelings play out so quickly, one after the other that we usually don't have time to really perceive them, let alone understand them.

Here's what happened:

I reached for the shampoo to wash my hair. **Immediately my brain pictured images of** how I have the head underwater and I perceived an unpleasant tingling in the head.

What just happened?

My brain warned me not to set a new standard.

I had already experienced what it felt like with my head in ice-cold water. My brain told me, "Alarm, alarm, alarm." 🚨🚔 **It's made to protect us from danger.**

## Summary: From this I have derived the following process of how we work through challenges

#1 🧠 Brain creates images/voices/feelings of challenge in the future (submodalities)

#2 ⚖ Make decision

#3 🏌️ Execution (ideally with 100% conviction)

#4 🏋️ Initial difficulty

#5 🏄 Flow state and new standard set

I'm excited to hear about you and your decisions this week.

Have a great week!

xx Luke
