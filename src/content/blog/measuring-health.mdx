👋 Hello Friend

I am in the process of improving my overall health, relationships, and wealth (work).

**My 90-Day Goal for Health is to have a constant energy level throughout the day.** 

Because I am a huge fan of measurement and data, I made a full body scan with scaneca.de last week @Cryoduct Zürich (definitely check them out if you are in Zurich, not sponsored 😄). The owner, Paula is one of the nicest people I have ever met and they have intergalactic biohacking machines.

With [scaneca.de](https://scaneca.de/) you will receive a 5-page pdf document with a full body analysis. 

This document contains the following:  

*   Volume of bodyparts
*   Circumference of bodyparts
*   Balance
*   Posture
*   Analysis of body parts like body fat, muscle mass, etc.

### These are the 2 Goals I am aiming to achieve in the next 2 months

#### **Goal 1: Upright posture, like the person in the photo (see below) & straight posture with minimal deviation (max. 0.3cm left-right)**

In the picture, one can see that due to the “right drift” of my upper body, the balance is slightly more to the left to counteract.

The text next to it says the same:

> "The left shoulder is 1.3 cm higher than the right shoulder. [...] The left hand is 2.0 cm higher than the right hand."

#### **Goal 2: Reduce body fat to < 15%.**

My waist-to-hip ratio is at 0.90. This is 0.04 points above the maximum a healthy person should have: 0.86.

**Plan to achieve this goal:** 

1.  150 minutes of level-2 cardio per week (tracking in my weekly habit tracker with Google Sheets)
2.  10.000 steps a day (tracking in my daily habit tracker with Google Sheets)
3.  limit sweets or intermittent fasting (16/8) 

I have made this analysis and goals by myself, and haven't spoken to a doctor or other health professional if my interpretation is 100% right. 

This is definitely on my To-Do List to get the document analyzed by a professional to see where the 20% focus should be to get 80% of the improvement. 

Have a healthy and energetic week! 

xx Lukas 😎
