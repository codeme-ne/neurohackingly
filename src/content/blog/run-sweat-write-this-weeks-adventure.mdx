### 🏃🏼‍♂️ I just started running, like Forrest Gump

One morning, I got onto the stepper for 20 minutes of cardio.

While my motivation level was soaring as I listened to a [motivational speech by Joe Rogan](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6hZqj5c7KMEOLyvRFspN5A), it occurred to me that I could continue working on [my ImPossible List](/impossiblelist/).

The first thing that I thought of doing was: _Just start running, like Forrest Gump_

A perfect day for a run

**One can't just let rare moments like this -> experiencing a feeling of commitment, let go. Take action.**

If you want to know if I stopped or whether I am still running, head over to the blog post ⬇️

I just started running, like Forest Gump

I get to check off “Just start running (like Forest Gump)” from my ImPossible List. This morning, I stood on the stepper while listening to a motivational speech by Joe Rogan on Spotify. He talked about pretending to be the main character of a superhero movie. The person is doing

### 🧖🏼‍♀️ Sauna for Health and Performance

I discuss my sauna routine and summarize the latest studies on how heat affects our bodies. [Huberman](https://www.hubermanlab.com/neural-network/deliberate-heat-exposure-protocols-for-health-and-performance) recommends **1 hour sauna per week, split into 2-3 sessions, with a temperature range of 80-100°C. (176-212°F)**

### 📜 The Art of Journaling: benefits of journaling and more

I talk about the benefits of journaling, what my journaling process looks like and, of course, some studies so that the cake has a base. ;)

#### 📔My current journaling routine looks like this.

![Book with two pages, left page: page for morning pages, right page: 3 questions I ask myself](/content/images/2023/09/journaling_my_routine-1.png)

My Journaling Template

**Page 1:** On this page, I capture what comes to my mind straight onto paper.

The spiritual windshield wipers free space for important and meaningful thoughts. [Tim Ferris](https://tim.blog/2015/01/15/morning-pages/amp/) calls writing down all your spiraling thoughts, which may have accumulated overnight, "life-changing."

> "Once we get those muddy, maddening, confusing thoughts \[nebulous worries, jitters, and preoccupations\] on the page, we face our day with clearer eyes.” - Julia Cameron

**Page 2:** On the second page, I answer 3 questions. (I change up the questions every week or so.)

#### ❓ Currently, I ask myself the following 3 questions:

1.  What am I grateful for? (3 things)
2.  What great things will I want to have experienced today?
3.  What 3 tasks will I be proud to have completed when I reflect on my day?

I write down 3 tasks only, not more.

During the day, I keep coming back, crossing off tasks. When I completed all 3 tasks, I write down 3 more. -> Less overwhelming than writing down all todos for the day.

#### Last but not least, I ask myself:

*   How do I want to be today?

I write down the answer 5 times.

Today, I wrote: _"I am a disciplined person. I am a disciplined person. I am a disciplined person. I am a disciplined person. I am a disciplined person."_

Writing it down multiple times has the effect of mentally sticking in my head throughout the day.
