👋 Hello friend

Welcome to Weekly Wins. 🌟 Let's dive into the nuggets of progress and discoveries from this past week:

Last week, I shared my **habit tracking journey.** I have added the goal of hitting **10,000 steps daily**. Spoiler: It's tougher than it may or may not sound!

Weekly Overview trying to reach 10.000steps/day

I've also been fine-tuning my sleep with the **SD8 Framework**:

*   **S**chedule 3 key tasks for tomorrow.
*   **D**igital Shutdown 1 hour before bed.
*   **8** hours of Zs, minimum.

**Audiobook Alert**: I'm hooked on [_The Diary of a CEO_](https://amzn.to/3uLeZpY) by Steven Bartlett. It's a goldmine of stories and psychology in business.

**This Week's Wisdom**: _"In relationships, like in bad marketing, we often pitch what matters to us, not what the other person needs. Shift your view; transform your connections."_ - from [Shortform](https://www.shortform.com/?utm_source=neurohackingly&utm_medium=partner): Gino Wickman, _Traction_

**Take Action Coaching Technique**

1.  Where do you want to be? On a scale (from 1-10) which measures where you want to be, this is probably a 10 out of 10.
2.  Which number represents where you are right now on the scale in relationship to your goal?
3.  Which one thing would take you up half a point?

... another half a point?

... another half a point?

Schedule the action points into your calendar.

**Master the 80/20 Principle:** I try to ask myself before each major task: What are 20% of the effort/things I should work on to achieve 80% of the result? I have an accountability buddy whom I message every day what I 80/20'd today. This is the best technique to implement 80/20.

**Beating Procrastination**: Some questions I posted on Reddit recently, I thought I'd share with you.

*   What will I maximize, and what will I minimize to get started as quickly as possible?
*   How can I make this fun?
*   Am I showing up as an amateur or a professional in this area of life?
*   How can I make it easier?
*   Am I managing my time or my energy?
*   How can I make this trackable?
*   What is the next micro-goal I could achieve to get me closer to the macro-goal I want to achieve?
*   How can I avoid bad habits and implement good ones by replacing the bad ones?
*   What are the behaviors/habits/process goals I could track to achieve my long-term goals?
*   Which obstacles might I face in the process of getting started, and how am I planning to overcome them?
*   What does my ideal self look like in the areas of health, work, and relationships?
*   Which courses, coaches, and groups could help me get started on what I want to achieve?
*   Would I get started if a stranger were holding a gun to the head of my loved one?
*   How can I make this fun, perhaps with instrumental studying music on Spotify?

Have a great week! 😄
