👋 Hello Friend

How can you get ultra-motivated in 60 seconds?

Even top athletes, entrepreneurs and high performers aren’t always 100% motivated. However, winners know how to get back on track.

## 💣 Here's how to get ultra-motivated in under one minute in 5 simple steps

1.  **🧘‍♂️ Get Focused**: Identify the ONE most important thing you’re hesitating on right now. Write it down.
2.  **🧭 Find the Mental Blockers**: What pain are you avoiding? Write down every reason you're procrastinating.
3.  **🏁 Visualize the Payoff**: Picture yourself at the finish line. Fully engage in the feeling of having completed the task.
4.  **😰 Magnify the Consequences**: What are the consequences of inaction? Write down the pain you will feel if you don't take action.
5.  **🌼 Just Show Up**: Showing up is half the battle. Whether it’s putting on your running shoes, typing that first word, or opening that book. Focus all your energy on just that one step.

## **Here's a message I got from my accountability coach this week**

_"There’s real power in making decisions. It’s a massive productivity hack because most of the energy and stress of entrepreneurship isn’t in the “doing”… it’s in deciding what to do. Figuring it out and cutting off alternatives – that’s what drains you._

_That’s why people like Steve Jobs wore the same clothes every day: fewer decisions._

_Our conversations use pre-decisions to give you clarity and avoid second-guessing. This week is about doing, following through on what you’ve already decided. The hardest part (deciding) is done._

_No need to second-guess. No need_ _to hesitate. Just get it done._

**_Execution is everything."_**

Have an awesome week! ☀️
