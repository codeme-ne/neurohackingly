👋 Hello friend

**Be sure to read this short one till the end, it's worth it. Promise. 🪄**

Often, we theoretically know the simplest things, but we don't actually apply them. Or perhaps we haven't fully understood them because we haven't made ourselves aware of them and gone through their application.

Today, I had such a moment in NLP (Neuro-linguistic Programming) coaching.

One of the first things you learn when learning Neuro-linguistic programming in the NLP Practitioner is:

> The map is not the territory.

Each individual has their own map of the world. Their own view of the world. How they see things and how they think things should be done.

That's a basic principle. So fundamental. 

My "Aha" moment was when I realized I had lived according to the map of others for a long time. This led to me mixing up different pieces of maps of others. Consequently, I didn't even know what seemed logical to do for myself.

As corny as it may sound: Finally, I know what it means to lose oneself. Damn, insight after insight. 💥

My coach put it in a nutshell: "You put the needs of others above yourself."

**This led me to ask the following question:**

*   Which fundamental principle you are currently neglecting or not fully living by, could be a possible solution to your problem?
*   Which principle or self-evident principle would you like to be more aware of and apply daily from now on? 

🌱 **Self-care is something so fundamental and essential:** If you don't function, how are you supposed to perform well as a mother/father/employee/boss/child/brother/sister?

### 💩 When Shit Hits The Fan

Nevertheless, I have the feeling that we only realize this when we are already going down the slope at 100 km/h in an avalanche and realize that it would have been good to build an avalanche wall a few hundred meters in front of the abyss to avoid falling into a bottomless hole.

**What is your avalanche wall?**

*   What small thing can you do today to feel better, become more resilient, and gradually build your big, massive, and indestructible avalanche wall?

Stickman built his wall - have you?

Have a great week, my friend. 😊
