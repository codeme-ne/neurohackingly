Hello Friend 👋

# Real progress comes from everyday decisions, not grand "lightbulb moments."

Let's explore how to harness these small steps for lasting impact.

* * *

## Aware A.M.s 🌅

Spend a few minutes each morning asking yourself:

1.  Who do I want to be today?
2.  How can I serve or add value to somebody today?
3.  What is the one thing that will make the most difference in my life right now?

## Find Your Flow 🌊

Experiment with different schedules to find what works for you.

Maybe you like working in bursts when at your peak &  
then take time to rest and reassess.

**Don't force a one-size-fits-all approach.**

## Mini Wins Gather Momentum 🪜

Improve by 1% each day. Take small actions, like:

*   Reading
*   Walking
*   Meditating

These may seem trivial, but they lead to significant progress.

**Routine beats inspiration.**

Me, trying to get 1% better each day from day 1. ⤴️

## Invest in Your Body 💪

Your body is your most important asset.

Treat exercise as a form of self-respect.

Not a chore.

## Plan and Focus 📆

Plan your week just for 30 minutes today,  
and design your busy productive schedule.

## Make the Right Choice ⚖️

Thousands of small decisions shape your life.

Choosing the harder option now helps fight our natural urge for short-term comfort.

This is known as [hyperbolic discounting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperbolic_discounting).

## Patience and persistence drive progress. 💥

Commit to improving daily, and believe in the power of compound interest.
