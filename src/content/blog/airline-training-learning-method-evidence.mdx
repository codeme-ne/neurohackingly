I spoke with a **flight instructor from one of Europe's most prestigious airlines.**

## These are four of the evidence-based training pillars for efficient learning that can be applied to areas like "learning how to learn" and "coaching":

**1\. Driven by data:** Learn what to focus on by using data from the past.

**2\. Competency-based:** Nine key competencies a pilot must have were identified. To not only train for a single event but for every possible future problem, emphasis is placed on the process rather than the outcome.

**3\. Learn from the positive:** Strengths are pointed out. The focus is not on what happened but on why it happened and, consequently, how to improve the pilot's competency.

**4\. Develop resilience:** By questions from the instructor the pilot creates self-efficacy in the area of independent learning.
