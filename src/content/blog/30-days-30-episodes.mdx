The 10-day Vipassana meditation seminar made me realize again how powerful it is to focus on **one subject area only,** with full immersion.

#### To act, and by having continuous small successes (while enjoying the process), is how to become good in anything.

In the book [The Motivation Myth](https://amzn.to/45kdKLF), Jeff Haden states that most successful people say that they first didn't realize that they were successful because they **focused so much on the process of acting** (with, of course, a little strategizing first) and only before starting to focus on the goal.

Not through a sudden sugar-induced high in the middle of the night, usually gone by the time you sit at your desk to start, or some motivational speech praising how to live your life to the fullest.

### 📆 Why start now?

On the 24th of August. It's a weird date to start, you might say.

I could wait until September 1st, which would be a good date to start. Or next Monday. Or how about when the full moon shines on the howling wolf on the third Friday in a leap year?

In my experience, the more you think up ideas, the less likely they will be executed.

## 🌷 My 30-Day Masterplan

Every day for 30 days, a blog post will be published on my website or podcast on the most popular platforms like Spotify, Apple Podcasts, and Google Podcasts. The episodes will be between 5 and 10 minutes long and are all about how to live a happier, healthier, and more fulfilling life.

My goal is to have at least 5 podcast interviews. I already have one special guest in my repertoire.

### 💃 Do you have a special talent or story?

If you have a story, knowledge to contribute, or other talents that fit this blog, please write me at [lukaszangerl@neurohackingly.com](mailto:lukaszangerl@neurohackingly.com) or on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/neurohackingly).

I look forward to hearing from you! Suggestions for topics you would be interested in are very welcome.

This was inspired by [Ship30for30](/checklist-ship30for30/), which I will join again this year.

### 🔑 Consistency is key

In the Vipassana seminar, we were always told:

> keep working, keep working

It's difficult to keep going when you are frustrated because you shifted your focus for the 1000th time back to your breath, your legs hurt, and you realize you forgot the chicken in the oven.

When you experience that you can do the goal that you set for yourself and this gets reinforced again and again, success will come automatically.

There is no shortcut, just hard work. As mentioned in the book [Motivation Myth](https://amzn.to/45EF5I0), there may be a hack on peeling a banana more quickly, but not for big life goals like building your own company or becoming CEO. This is "just" hard work and consistency.
