👋 Hello friend

I'm really fascinated by the daily routines of "successful" people.

I've noticed that setting long-term goals and organizing my day accordingly brings me a great sense of satisfaction as well.

🎥 I recently came across Ali Abdaal, who talked about [a method he learned from his business coach](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=Jcoam1CeAq4&t=844s&pp=ygUZYWxpIGFiZGFhbCBidXNpbmVzcyBjb2FjaA%3D%3D) (charging $2500/hour) Suprisingly, the most impactful exercise was writing down his ideal week.

#### 🛠️ This inspired me to take another look at my ideal day and make a few adjustments. Here's how it goes:

## 🎊 My perfect Day:

*   0600: Wake up and drink a liter of water with a pinch of Himalayan salt.
*   0610: Run 5-10km in barefoot shoes without music (apparently, running with music is cheating, according to David Goggins).
*   0700: Breakfast (eggs, vegetables, + slow juiced carrot and ginger juice).
*   0730: Shit, shower, shave. 🧖🏻‍♂️
*   0750: Plan my day, involving one mentally challenging task to start with. Remembering that the process of problem-solving & thinking is the goal, not just achieving an outcome. Also, I plan for one physically demanding challenge in the afternoon.
*   0800: Dive into a mentally challenging 90-minute work block.
*   0930: Take a [Yoga Nidra](https://hubermanlab.com/master-your-sleep-and-be-more-alert-when-awake/) break.
*   1000: Admin Time (working through my To-Do's) / 2nd Work block.
*   1200: Enjoy a light lunch and maybe take a 15-minute nap.
*   1245: Another work block begins.
*   1500: Time for a physical challenge, like swimming, ice bath, cycling, running, or lifting weights.
*   1630: Embrace a 1-hour meditation session.
*   1730: Hop into the ice chamber/sauna for some rejuvenation.
*   1800: Tidy up and prepare for the next day.
*   1900: Fun & Friends time.
*   2100: Stretch & relax before bedtime.
*   2200: Journaling, noting down my accomplishments and what I'm grateful for.

⏱️ To keep myself on track, I set six alarms each day, marking the start of each part of my day.

This acts as a reset button if the previous block didn't go as planned. I got this idea from watching [Rian Doris](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=hApnn1vnWi0&pp=ygUKUmlhbiBEb3Jpcw%3D%3D)' videos, where he explains it in detail. Here are the SIX Alarms:

*   0600: Wake up
*   0800: Morning work block
*   1200: Lunch
*   1300: Afternoon work block
*   1800: Fun, friends & relax
*   2130: Wind down for bed

Keep in mind that this is my ideal routine, and if I can achieve it on 4 days out of 7, I'll already be happy. 🙂

I find myself coming back to it whenever I'm unsure of what to do in the next few hours.

Now, I'm curious – what does your ideal day look like? Feel free to drop me a message and share. 📩
