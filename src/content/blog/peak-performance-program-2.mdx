[Read my review of the Peak Performance Program](/peak-performance-program/) 2024 by Eric Partaker.

I am currently attending Eric Partaker's (the CEO Coach of Ali Abdaal) 5-week Peak Performance Program. Eric Partaker normally **charges $2500/h for 1:1 coaching.** Fortunately, I got the Peak Performance Program for less money, with a huge amount of value. 🤑💸

In today's newsletter edition, I share the **most valuable lesson I got from 360 minutes** **of transformative teaching** so far. (_+_ _a free downloadable reflection template_ called "The Dream Team")

> "If there is one thing to implement into your life from the Peak Performance Program it would be "The Dream Team" Exercise." - Eric Partaker

You can combine this exercise with setting 3 Alarms, but more on this later.

### The Dream Team Exercise takes 5 minutes a day to reflect on the Ideal Version of Yourself in 3 Areas:

*   **🩺 Health**
*   **💼 Wealth**
*   **💏 Relationships**

#### For each Domain, (Health, Wealth & Relationships) you should answer the following 4 Questions:

*   Identity: What is your Identity in this domain? You at your best.
*   Values: 3 words that describe how this version of you behaves.
*   Goal: An exciting long-term goal this version of you could achieve.
*   Today's Highlight: The #1 Thing you will do today to "prove" you are being this champion version of yourself.

🔁 Then Repeat the 4 questions for the other 2 Domains.

**Free downloadable Template**: You can find a Google doc with the Dream Team Practice. 👇

### Bestselling Book from Eric Partaker: The 3 Alarms

To remind yourself at which time of the day which Version of Yourself will be active you set 3 Alarms on your Phone.

The 3 Alarms on my Phone + Digital Sunset Alarm

The alarms will remind you to concentrate on one single area of your life and to act from the ideal version of yourself you have manifested in the morning.

I have many more golden nuggets coming your way next week.

Feel free to write me any questions that come up. You can download **Eric Partaker’s 100-page bestselling book "The 3 Alarms", for free** [here](https://ericpartaker.com/the-3-alarms).
