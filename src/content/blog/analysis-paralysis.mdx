👋 Hello friend

For a long time, I've been thinking about what to write in this week's newsletter.

I've convinced myself that the first newsletter after a long break has to be perfect, filled with facts, undiscovered helpful advice, all presented with charm and a touch of fun.

Perfect approach if your goal is to **not** take action. Try it. 😉

Sometimes I find myself pondering how it could be and spending so much time thinking about it, instead of simply taking action and seeing what unfolds.

I recently stumbled upon a quote from Epictetus, that kicks butt:

> “Now is the time to get serious about living your ideals. How long can you afford to put off who you really want to be? Your nobler self cannot wait any longer.

> Put your principles into practice – now. Stop the excuses and the procrastination. This is your life! You aren’t a child anymore. The sooner you set yourself to your spiritual program, the happier you will be. The longer you wait, the more you’ll be vulnerable to mediocrity and feel filled with shame and regret, because you know you are capable of better.

> From this instant on, vow to stop disappointing yourself. Separate yourself from the mob. Decide to be extraordinary and do what you need to do – now.” - [_The Art of Living_](https://amzn.to/46zKcKP)

Have a great week!
