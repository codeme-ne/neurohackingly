Hello friends,

welcome to my First Official Newsletter and thank you very much for signing up. Every Sunday evening I will be sharing with you actionable productivity tips, practical life advice, and high-quality insights from across the web, directly to your inbox.

  
So let us start!

📃 The To-Do List. Who does not know it? My To-Do list is several pages long. Just imagining opening makes my hands sweat. Why not turn it around and try the radical opposite?

This week I came across a blog written by the author of the [4-Hour Workweek](https://www.amazon.com/4-Hour-Workweek-Escape-Live-Anywhere/dp/0307465357) (one of my favourite books) Tim Ferris, who writes about the **"Not To Do List".**

> What you don't do influences what you can do.

If you want you can read the article [here](https://tim.blog/2007/08/16/the-not-to-do-list-9-habits-to-stop-now/). My favorite items are number **2\. do not e-mail first thing in the morning or last thing at night.** and number **8\. do not carry a cellphone or Crackberry 24/7**. Definitely something I will try out next week when going on holiday to Greece.

🎆 This week has shown me again that if you go through life with a certain openness, you will meet exactly those people who are on the same wavelength. You just need a little courage and patience.

If you have any suggestions or requests for the next blog post, feel free to write me at neurohackingly@gmail.com. I look forward to your message.  
  
Have a great week!

Lukas xx

## ✍🏻 Quote of the week:

> One of the most helpful things you can do is ask yourself if the decision will matter five years from now, Peters adds. Relationships, houses, jobs — probably. But in five years, will you care that you chose the steak over the chicken, or picked the blue sweater over the red one?
