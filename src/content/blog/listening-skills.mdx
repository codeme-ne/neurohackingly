I sought advice from a communication specialist with **more than 35 years of experience.**

She told me that **two components make up effective communication.**

*   Listening skills
*   Speaking skills

## 3 Listening Skills for effective communication

### 🦻 Listening receptively

Pay attention to your partner.

**Show interest** by interjecting or asking questions.

**Nod and look** at your partner.

### 🗣 Listen first, then Paraphrase

**Repeat in your own words** what your partner said.

Doing this will give your partner feedback.

It makes sure that you have **understood him or her correctly.**

### ❓ Ask Open Questions

Is your partner **expressing his feelings and desires indirectly?**

Are you not sure what he's feeling?

**Ask specific questions. Avoid closed questions** that can only be answered with yes or no.

* * *

[Sign up for my newsletter](/newsletter/) to ensure you **don't miss the three speaking skills.** These have especially brought my professional relationships to the next level.
