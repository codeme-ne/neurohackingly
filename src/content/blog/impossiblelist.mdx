This, my ImPossible List is a very personal page, but I believe in sharing it with you:

1.  To **motivate and inspire** to create your own ImPossible List.
2.  Because **making it public** increases the likelihood of me following through.
3.  To entertain. 😋

> Unlike a bucket list, with the Impossible List, you can **incrementally work** your way up to achieve your higher goals in life. The ImPossible List is designed to **take action** right away.

You can find inspiring examples of other ImPossible Lists on the websites of [Thomas Frank](https://collegeinfogeek.com/about/meet-the-author/my-impossible-list/) and [Joel Runyon.](https://impossiblehq.com/impossible-list/)

**This is my ImPossible List, which is ever-evolving.**
