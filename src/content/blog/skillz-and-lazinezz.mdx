👋 Hello Friend

## ❓Focus Question of the Week

Imagine every area of your life keeps progressing as it has in the past, but **ONE area/thing in your life changes significantly for the better.** Which change would have the most impact? 

My answer is: my HEALTH: getting 8 hours of good quality sleep

How can you achieve this?

E.g. By focusing on relaxing and having me-time 2 hours before going to bed.

😫 **If you try to improve everything at once, nothing improves and you will burn out.**

**🚀 Ask yourself: What is the one area where significant improvement would have the greatest impact?**

## 🏄‍♀️Improving your Skillz

I am just heading home from a great week in Marokko. Surfing, sun & fun.

Speaking of surfing. If you want to get your hard & soft skills to the next level, I would recommend reading the very short but inspiring book [The Little Book of Talent](https://amzn.to/3vbNUfZ), by Daniel Coyle. It has a list of 52 Tips for improving your skills.

If you don't want to read the whole book, you can read [the summary from Derek Sivers](https://sive.rs/book/LittleBookOfTalent).

The strategies in "The Little Book of Talent" helped me to surf the big green waves within one day. However, I have to admit: I have snowboarding experience and went surfing on a standing wave for one hour.

## 🥱How to cure your Laziness

These tips are from [the video of Eric Partaker](https://ericpartaker.com/blog/ppi-175-the-cure-to-laziness-this-could-change-your-life).

#### Starting = The Hardest Part

The Rest Will Follow - Finishing something can feel overwhelming, just starting takes a second. **Adopt the mentality: I choose to start for just 5 minutes.**

#### Prioritize! 

Are you feeling overwhelmed by your to-do list? What is the ONE thing that you could do that will help you progress, just an inch forward? **Pick your most important task & start with that.**

#### Perfection Is An Illusion 

Often we feel lazy when seeking perfection. Perfect is impossible to attain. **Focus on improving by 1%.**

#### Sleep

The number one thing I do when I am feeling frustrated, overwhelmed, and anxious is to sleep. Are you feeling lazy because you are actually tired? Is the feeling of laziness actually your body wanting to recharge & get energy back? **Ensure you are getting 8 hours of sleep per night.**

Have a great week! 🌞
