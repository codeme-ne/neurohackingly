👋🏼 Hello friend

This weekend, I had a wonderful experience.

I was in the middle of nowhere - a 20-minute drive to the nearest train station.

As there was no public transport on the weekends and I had called all available cab companies (okay, I admit there were only two), I had only one option: hitchhiking. 🥾

I got out pen and paper (and 110% of my courage), and wrote down the name of the next train station on a piece of paper. I reserved myself a premium spot next to a gas station where passing cars could see my despair. And so the rejection journey began.

_"This is good training for life."_, so at least I told myself.

After more than 10 _not yet successful_ attempts and some confused drivers, I changed the sign to "Somewhere towards Vienna."

![Sign "somewhere in direction Vienna"](/images/knowledge-vs-experience/070DD88D-40E0-45C2-B0F0-132AD0215F4C-1.jpeg)

"somewhere in the direction of Vienna"

Somehow_,_ I got even more confused looks. Alright, back to the original sign then ...

Finally, after more than 20 cars had already driven past, I saw a silver car approaching. I held up my sign_,_ and ... the car drove past me.

Then suddenly braked. A friendly woman offered to take me to another train station, where she drove to pick up her boyfriend.

The evening was filled with exciting conversations. They invited me for tee to their vacation home by a small stream in the middle of nature, as I would have had to wait another 2 hours in the cold for the next train to arrive.

#### **This experience taught me 3 Things:**

*   People are lovely; you just have to be open to it.
*   You cannot fail unless you quit. (**What counts is the actual experience** of experiencing this repeatedly rather than theoretical understanding.)
*   I need a vacation home with a fireplace in the countryside. 😉

On that note, have a great week, and see you soon.

xx Lukas 🙂

> "When it comes to learning a new skill, there are two kinds of people.  
> One kind prefers to first study the typewriter, while the other starts by pounding on the keys.  
> One kind likes to first master the grammar of a foreign language, while the other learns in the trenches, using body language if they must.  
> Generally speaking, the second type tends to learn faster than the first, because the latter is not afraid of making mistakes." - [The Things You Can Only See When You Slow Down](https://amzn.to/3MQer8i) by Haemin Sunim
