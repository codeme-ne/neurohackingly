👋 Hello friend

Vacations are the perfect opportunity for me to read books.

First, I use [Shortform](https://www.shortform.com/?utm_source=neurohackingly&utm_medium=partner) to get an overview of the book. If it then scores well in the "relevant to my current situation" and "want to read it" categories, I'll buy the physical version.

## My 6 key takeaways from the book — **Die with Zero: Getting All You Can from Your Money and Your Life,** by Bill Perkins

### 💀 #1. **Find out how long you are likely to live**

Take the test on [Living to 100](https://livingto100.com/calculator) to find out how long people with your current health condition live on average.

Then use a countown timer/widget on your phone to remind yourself each day how many years you have left. This may sound unusual at first, but it teaches you to appreciate each day more consciously.

### 🗺️ #2. **It's about experiences, not just money**

The goal should not be to accumulate as much money as possible, but how many valuable experiences you can buy with your money.

Money alone is useless - it's the experiences that enrich your life.

### 🪂 #3. **Plan experiences for different phases of your life**

Make a list of things you want to experience at certain stages of your life.

For example, you might want to plan activities like skydiving or freediving between the ages of 25 and 40 because you're fitter at that age than at 70 or 80.

### 🤩 #4. **Memories bring joy - for a lifetime**

The earlier you collect special experiences, the more time you have to remember them later and be happy about them.

Every time you think back to these moments, you will experience the good feeling again.

### 🩺 #5. **Health is the best investment**

Looking after your health is one of the best decisions you can make.

It not only prolongs your life, but also ensures that you can enjoy it better. Many experiences - like mountain climbing or scuba diving - are only possible if you are fit.

### 💸 #6. **Know when to spend your wealth**

There should come a time when you start spending more money than you earn to make sure you die with 0 in your bank account.

Many people have more money at the age of 75 than they did at 50, even though they can no longer spend it. In fact, most people spend less and less money as they get older.

You should know when you reach your financial peak and start using your wealth wisely.

### Summary

Die with Zero explains why it makes sense to spend your money on experiences throughout your life instead of dying with a large fortune.

*   **How to Not Die Alone** by Logan Ury - A great book about relationships, whether you're already in one or still looking.
*   **Someday is Today** by Matthew Dicks - Practical tips on how to make your everyday life more productive and creative.

Have a productive week! ☀️
