## 🌞 What's up?

The break has gone a little shorter than expected.

Honestly, I've already been drawn to write a [blog article](/favourite-apps-phone/) about the **4 favourite apps I have on my phone** to capture thoughts, images, recordings etc.

I have updated [this page with my favourite books of all time](/my-favourite-apps/) and some other stuff.

I guess sometimes it's the things you don't like that you replace with the things you do like, that cause stress. In short, **procrastination got me** BUT I've got most of the smaller things done now.

## 🎭 Making use of your future self

I think it's a cool idea to make ones **future-self's life easier**. What do I mean by that?

When we **see ourselves from the outside** we are emotionally more distant. We are not so much involved in our own recurring thought spiral. We see ourselves as another person and friend. Most of the time we **do more for friends than for ourselves.** This we can use.

My considerations: I use this trick to stop procrastination. I want that Future Lukas has more time for other things that make him fun. 👴🏼

## 🍂 What is next?

Somehow I managed to make a small **series of videos explaining how I create my website** with ghost.org. It's really fun, also because I can finally repeat HTML, CSS, and Javascript again. Speaking of programming.

I'm in the process of editing an interview with **a guest I had on the podcast** the other day. We talk about how programming helps us think differently, better and also expand the way we make decisions.

`exciting`

Have a great week!

xx Lukas
