👋 Hello friend,

Do you know the feeling?

You're determined to give it your all and tackle your long-awaited goals. Yet, after five minutes on the computer, you end up **being distracted**, looking up new things that fit into your home on Amazon. You blame yourself, but at the same time, the **negative self-talk keeps you from taking action.**

![The image displays the interface of a platform called "Haction Hub." The interface has a dark-themed sidebar on the left with various channel names such as "community-challenges," "general," "helpful-resources," "inspiration-zone," "introduction-igloo," "small-successes," "staff-here," "Add channels," and "Direct messages." The "introduction-igloo" channel is highlighted.  In the main content area, the "#introduction-igloo" channel is open, showing a few messages. One user, "neurohack3rghy," posted a message that says:  "Hello friend. Why don’t polar bears get married? Because they all have cold feet! 😆 Now it’s your turn. What’s your best icebreaker joke? Or just tell us what your goals are and why you joined the community. Let’s create a warm and friendly atmosphere where everyone feels connected and valued!"  Above this message, there is an automated message from Slackbot in German, explaining that this channel is a standard channel for new members joining the Haction Hub. It also notes that this channel can be removed from standard channels in the workspace settings.](/content/images/2024/06/Haction-Hub-Community.png)
