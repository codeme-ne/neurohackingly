Over the last 3 years, I filled 10 journals.

I experimented with pre-made templates, free-text writing, morning pages, and other journaling methods.

After thousands of diary entries, I discovered this simple and powerful 3-step Journaling Framework.

## My Simple 3-Step Journaling Framework for Perfectionists To Prioritize and Plan The Day

### ☀️ Highlight

Your Daily Highlight should be _60-90 minutes_ long and be executed when you have maximum energy and focus.

3 Ways to Pic Your Highlight: Urgentcy, Satisfaction, Joy.

Read [Choose a Highlight To Make Time Every Day](https://maketime.blog/article/choose-a-highlight-to-make-time-every-day/) for a detailed explanation.

### 🎯 Goal

Every month, I define one life area I give particular focus on.

I set a small goal for the day to improve this area.

Today, for example, it was a leg workout.

Focus area January: Health

### 🤏 Less

Instead of adding more things that should be done, I ask myself:

_What do I want to do less of?_

This could be as simple as not scrolling through my phone when bored.

Honestly, I wish someone had told me this journaling method earlier.

But I'm at least glad I can pass them along to you.
