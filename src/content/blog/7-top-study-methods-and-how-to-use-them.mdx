## 7 Top Study Methods and How To Use Them

![boy is thinking about studying](/content/images/2022/12/studying_techniques.png)

**7\. Immerse yourself in the new thing you are learning.**  
This is why Tony Robbins' events last up to an entire week, 16 hours every day. The book [Ultralearning by Scott Young](https://amzn.to/3hhZmzI) explains that to learn a new language, it is best to live in an environment where people speak it.

**6\. Explain the concept using simple language.**  
Imagine you are teaching the subject to a small child or someone who has never heard of it before.

**5\. Write down questions instead of notes.**  
[This](/as-a-student-note-taking-is-a-revision-technique-you-should-avoid/) recent blog post explains that there are more high-utility learning techniques than taking notes—for instance, active recall (using [Notion's toggle feature](https://notion.grsm.io/fd22ad3hsm5v)).

**4\. Learn for 40–50 minutes. Then take a break. Lay around for 10 minutes and let your mind wander. Then Repeat.**  
Important: You should be focused while and after learning; using your phone will harm your learning.

**3\. Go over the material the same evening you learned it.**  
This is because, in the evening, recall has already slipped significantly after a morning lecture. So your brain has to make some effort. But it hasn't fallen so low that you have to learn everything all over again.

**2\. Get critical feedback to understand your blind spots and focus on them.**  
Don't focus on improving areas you are already good at. Let's say you are a bodybuilder. Suppose your legs are already your dominant body part. Should you focus on training your legs or building other muscle groups?

**1\. Teach it to someone else.**  
[This study](https://link.springer.com/article/10.3758/s13421-014-0416-z#Sec4) shows that studying with the expectation that you will teach it to someone else is more effective than studying if you are tested on it at an exam.

As always, have a great week! 🎇
