Hello friend,

My friend Onjae from neurodoses.com is a brain health coach and clinical herbalist. 

He helps to boost brain health & emotional well-being with microdosing, nootropics, biohacking, and other holistic strategies.

Last week, I talked with him for about an hour, and I can 100% recommend him from a coaching and personal side of view. Microdosing and Nootropics are things I don’t know much about… However, like Richard Feynman, Onjae had simple and understandable explanations for my questions. Even I understood it. 🤓

If this sounds like an area you want to explore, [discover free out-of-this-world resources](https://neurodoses.com/beginners-guide/) or book a free 30-minute coaching session with Onjae from neurodoses.com. 

Nothing to lose, so much to gain. :) 

Have a great week!

xx Lukas
