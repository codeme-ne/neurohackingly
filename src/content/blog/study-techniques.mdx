Learning how to learn is so close to my heart because it can be applied to all areas of life.

Learning strategies and studying tips from my 20-year learning career:

## 5 secret study tips you probably never heard about

### 🤸🏼‍♀️ Study tip #1: VAKOG

VAKOG is an acronym for visual, auditory, kinesthetic, olfactory, and gustatory.

The more senses you use when studying, the better you consume and retrieve new information. Learning is suddenly exciting because you ask yourself, "How can I best remember this information? Which sensory channel do I want to associate with it?"

### 📷 Study tip #2: We think in pictures

I usually find looking at pictures or graphics to understand new information most accessible.

All those facts and details are packed into this little picture. Sometimes, I even see these pictures or graphics before me when trying to find answers for my exams. This is because 50% of our neurons process visual information.

### 🤣 Study tip #3: Manage your state

Humans can absorb information best when they are in a good state.

This is why it is so important to be in a good mood when sitting at your desk. In Neurolinguistic Programming, this is called state management (my favorite subject when discussing NLP). Here are my most common techniques to catapult me from a stuck state into a resourceful state:

*   taking a cold shower
*   priming my brain with Tony Robbins (caution, very addictive 😀)

*   bouncing my chest like King Kong
*   think about all the things I am grateful for
*   Dancing to motivating music, check out my Spotify playlist:

My Workout Playlist

I will have a future article about state management and how you can live more joyfully.

### ✍🏼 Study tip #4: Scoping the subject

When learning new information, it is essential to skim the book/script to get a general idea of the structure.

Your brain now knows the available content and structure of the book and can organize the information better. From big to small is what they always told us in pilot school. After skimming the book, you will know where to put the information you are reading, and you will be surprised how much more information you will suddenly understand.

### 🍃 Study tip #5: Switch up your workplace

If you study a subject for a certain amount of time, sooner or later, there will probably be thoughts like: "It's always the same—every single day. "

I've discovered it's much easier to get going when I change locations and don't spend all day in my room. One day, I go to Starbucks; the other day, I spend at the library, and the next, in a meadow. It's amazing what a slight change of scenery can do for you. Your brain will thank you.

I would recommend trying one of the five tips at a time. Give yourself time and be gentle with yourself.
