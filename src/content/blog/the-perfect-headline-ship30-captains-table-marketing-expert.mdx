✅ Use 1 of the **5 Proven Headline Styles:** _The List, The Story, The Opinion, The Question, The Framework_

✅ \***WHAT am I writing about?**

✅ \*What **TYPE OF CONTENT** can I expect? (5 hacks, ideas, stories etc.)

✅ \***WHO am I writing for?** _(age, name, location, marriage status, education, car, music)_

✅ \*FOR WHAT? What value does it provide to the reader? e.g. For what should the reader learn tennis? **In order to** [be healthy].

✅ \*Twist the knife (**expand** the FOR WHAT, what else will the reader get?)

✅ \*Is the title clear or **am I trying to be funny again**?

✅ **Credibility** (what credibility do you or another person have on that topic)

✅ Make up **words that stick** (e.g. instead of “Pomodoro Method” → “Simple & Short Study-Session”)

✅ Can I use another word that creates **emotion or pictures**?

✅ Put **verbs at the beginning**

✅ The reader often **only reads the first 3 words**

### The final 3 steps before publishing the headline

1.  Let the headline sit for 24 hours
2.  Then look at it on a different device
3.  Read it out Loud

\* = mandatory
