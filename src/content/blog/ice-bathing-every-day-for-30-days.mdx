For the past 30 Days, I went Ice Bathing Every Day.

![](/images/ice-bathing-every-day-for-30-days/Header-Banner-for-Blog.jpg)

I have been doing Ice Bathing and Cryotherapy for 4 years. I have already written about ice bathing in two of my email newsletters:

*   [Why getting into an ice bath is comparable to any other challenge in our lives](/en-wim-hof-method-decision/#the-imagesthoughtsfeelings-play-out-so-quickly-one-after-the-other-that-we-usually-dont-have-time-to-really-perceive-them-let-alone-understand-them).
*   [Self-Help Nuggets](/self-help-nuggets/)

I want to share my knowledge for ice bathing beginners. 🧑‍🔬

### 🧠 Ice bathing has physical and mental benefits

Take a short time to calm the mind by focusing on the breath.

Ice bathing doesn't just have health benefits. Like Vipassana meditation, it teaches us to recognize the present situation. Feeling cold is just a feeling like any other. It arises and passes away sooner or later.

Maybe you have already thought when sitting in ice-cold water: Why am I doing this to myself?

The monkey mind gets louder. It tries to find one reason after the other why you should NOT CONTINUE. It searches for reasons to get out of the ice bath NOW.

### ⏸️ You choose how you react to stress.

You have found a safe way to expose your body under enormous stress purposely.

You can train yourself to look at the situation with equanimity. Your response will be slightly different the next time your life throws a stressful situation at you. (Even you may not notice it) We retrain our behavior patterns.

Your body doesn't know whether you've just been fired or are about to take an important exam.

The physiological effect of stress is the same. You can use ice bathing as a tool to train your resilience.

### 🕺 The Power of the Horse Stance After The Ice Bath

What do most people do after getting out of the ice bath?

Usually, they grab a towel. I did the same before attending the [Wim Hoff workshop from Peakwolf](https://www.peakwolf.ch/) in Thun, Switzerland. In this 3-hour workshop, Peakwolf taught us that it's important NOT to dry off after the ice bath.

Instead, you do the Horse Stance, moving your hands from side to side.
