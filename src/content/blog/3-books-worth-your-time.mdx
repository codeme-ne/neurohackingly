Over the past few years, I've read 100 self-help and business books.

Unfortunately, most were a waste of time—they could have been blog posts or even email newsletters.

**Instead, I want to encourage you to read these 3 books. 🔥**

They're definitely worth your time.

The first book is already my absolute favorite:

### ⏳Book #1: **"Make Time" by Jake Knapp and John Zeratsky**

I first read this book in 2020 and even took their [Highlight-Course](https://maketime.blog/the-highlight-course/) based on it.

**3 surprising insights I learned from the book:**

1.  The authors, former designers at Google and YouTube, unveil how tech companies design products to hijack your attention—and how you can reclaim it. It's an eye-opening look behind the screens you interact with daily.
2.  The book doesn't just offer theories—it provides 87 specific, easy-to-apply tips to help you focus your attention, protect that focus from distractions, and boost your energy levels.
3.  Discover how dedicating just 60-90 minutes each day to a single, meaningful task can dramatically boost your productivity and satisfaction—a surprisingly simple method that sidesteps overwhelming to-do lists.

### 🤑Book #2: **"Oversubscribed" by Daniel Priestley**

Ali Abdaal recommends this book again and again. In his latest [interview with Daniel Priestley](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwLqwcjJwRo), he mentioned it’s the book with the most Kindle highlights for him.

**Here are the top 3 things the book taught me:**

1.  The book reveals that demand breeds more demand. As more people show interest in your product, others become intrigued simply because it's popular and scarce.
2.  Surprisingly, mass marketing methods like TV commercials and print ads are becoming less effective. The book explains that consumers are so inundated with ads that they often ignore them entirely.
3.  The book advises waiting until you have a significant amount of interest—sometimes up to 100 times your capacity—before you start selling. This ensures a successful launch with eager customers.

* * *

**Ultimately, I think everyone should read this book:**

### 🚵‍♀️Book #3: **"The Motivation Myth" by Jeff Haden**

**3 things I didn't know before reading this book:**

1.  Most people believe they need motivation to start pursuing their goals. This book flips that idea, showing that motivation actually comes _after_ you begin taking action and experiencing small successes.
2.  Contrary to popular belief, telling others about your goals can make you less likely to achieve them. The premature praise you receive can create a false sense of accomplishment, reducing your drive to follow through.
3.  It's counterintuitive, but saying "no" to distractions and even attractive opportunities can significantly enhance your focus and resilience. By declining tasks that don't align with your primary goals, you conserve valuable time and energy.
