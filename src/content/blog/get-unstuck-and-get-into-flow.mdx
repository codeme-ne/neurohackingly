Not all lessons are created equal.

Some lessons we learn are small. They are little reminders along the way of what truly matters.

Other lessons are giant. They **fundamentally change the course of our entire lives.**

Over the past 5 years, I have studied at university and pilot school. These are the 5 most important lessons I've learned about **how to get unstuck and get into flow:**

## 1.🌊 [Wingwave music](https://besser-siegmund.myshopify.com/en?ref=yPXjsS_1Ta4REg)

Wingwave music is used in **performance coaching.** These alternating tones on the left and right ear lead to activating the prefrontal cortex in the cerebrum and improving networking performance. These are **perfect conditions to get into the flow state** fast.

My favourite Tracks: WINGWAVE, EARWAVE and PACIFIC WAVE

## 2.🎵 Noisli

On [this website](https://www.noisli.com/), you can **combine 28 different background sounds** to create a learning atmosphere you can concentrate on.

## 3.🔁 Switch your studying material

If you are learning out of a script**,** **switch to something differen**t like:

*   YouTube video
*   An app that reads the text from the script aloud
*   get a friend to test you

## 4.🎭 Model a superstar in the field

Do you know a person who gets into the flow quickly? **How** does she do it? What are their **strategies**?

## 5.✨ Pretend

Another very effective coaching method is **to pretend** (as if you are in the flow). Do you remember **how you felt the last time you were in the zone?** How did you breathe? What was your posture like? Recreate a **recipe** for that moment.

## Recap:

1\. Listen to music 🎵

2\. Use another learning medium 🔁

3\. Modeling 🎭

4\. Pretend ✨
