    5 Quick and Easy Lessons To Get Into Flow and Master New Information
    (unique)

Not all lessons are created equal.

Some lessons we learn are small. They are little reminders along the way of what truly matters.

Other lessons are giant. They **fundamentally change the course of our entire lives.**

Over the past 5 years, I have studied at university and pilot school. These are the 5 most important lessons I've learned about **how to get unstuck and get into flow:**

## 1.🌊 [Wingwave music](https://besser-siegmund.myshopify.com/en?ref=yPXjsS_1Ta4REg)

Wingwave music is used in **performance coaching.** These alternating tones on the left and right ear lead to activating the prefrontal cortex in the cerebrum and improving networking performance. These are **perfect conditions to get into the flow state** fast.

## 2.🎵 Noisli

On [this website](https://www.noisli.com/), you can **combine 28 different background sounds** to create a learning atmosphere you can concentrate on.

## 3.🔁 Switch your studying material

If you are learning out of a script**,** **switch to something differen**t like:

*   YouTube video
*   An app that reads the text from the script aloud
*   get a friend to test you

## 4.🎭 Model a superstar in the field

Do you know a person who gets into the flow quickly? **How** does she do it? What are their **strategies**?

## 5.✨ Pretend

Another very effective coaching method is **to pretend** (as if you are in the flow). Do you remember **how you felt the last time you were in the zone?** How did you breathe? What was your posture like? Recreate a **recipe** for that moment.

## Recap:

1\. Listen to music 🎵

2\. Use another learning medium 🔁

3\. Modeling 🎭

4\. Pretend ✨
