👋 Hello friend

I hope you missed me last week. Or maybe you didn't even notice.

Anyhow, enjoy reading today's edition. 🤗

## 🌱 [Outlive: The Science and Art of Longevity](https://amzn.to/3KcWQpY)

##   
A Book on increasing healthspan and lengthening lifespan

After listening to two episodes with Dr. Peter Attia on [The Tim Ferris Show](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2APEcpmaPb9LUovXGUCCPW) and [Huberman Lab](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2Kx52dG1uL75VZ2mdfAQdw) I had to preorder this amazing audiobook. It will be released tomorrow, march 28th, and I am totally looking forward to it.

It is a life project of Dr. Peter Attia, where he talks about things we can do now to prevent worse from happening in the future.

> "This is not “biohacking,” it’s science: a well-founded strategic and tactical approach to extending lifespan while also improving our physical, cognitive, and emotional health." - Dr. Peter Attia

**For German Podcast Listeners:**

## 🔔 New NLP Podcast [Sprachmagie: Wie Worte unser Denken beeinflussen](https://marianzefferer.at/sprachmagie) with host Marian Zefferer

> "How to unleash your communicative potential, create more impact in conversation and develop inspiring everyday language are core contents of this podcast." - Marian Zefferer

NLP-Trainer and psychologist Marian Zefferer has released a second Podcast Channel, with "Die Magie der Selbstbeeinflussung" being the first one. I can 100% recommend both podcasts.

## 📸 Use Panoramic Vision to Reduce Stress and Anxiety

**If we are relaxed**, we have panoramic vision and see our whole environment. We literally have a big picture of the situation.

Normally we don't notice this happening, **but if we are stressed,** the information that is delivered through our vision changes.

Breathing and vision have a profound effect on our inner state of mind. This runs in both directions.

#### How to widen your vision to reduce stress and anxiety

Don't actively move your eyes left and right, but while looking straight ahead, try to see the surrounding you are in. Direct your attention to your peripheral. If you don't know what I mean, here is [an explanation of Dr. Andrew Huberman.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dqCEOJSvgwA)

Like this, you are turning off your stress mechanism that drives your internal state toward stress.

**Like with breathing, I now tell myself: "Take a deep, wide vision."** 😉

Have a great week! 🏆
