Tony Robbins is one of the **best salespeople who ever lived.**

WARNING! This may sound manipulative. I am simply impressed, as I think I have "fallen for it", too.

However, he also delivers what he promises. I am a big fan of his.

### 💕 #1 Develop good rapport by matching and mirroring gestures, breathing patterns, and voice to make them like you personally

Then **find their needs** by asking: "What do you really want?" (People will tell you with good rapport.)

When having rapport, lead them into a **good buying state** by asking questions. Change their focus by asking: "What would it be like if it worked?"

### 🤓 #2 Provide Logic and reason so that they have just enough details to justify an emotional decision

*   DO NOT list facts and statistics
*   integrate your information naturally with **storytelling**

### 💸⏳ #3 The most common excuses are "I don't have the time." and "I don't have the money." In reality, they just don't know if it's worth it. (while keeping rapport!)

**Attack by telling what other people missed because they said the two most common excuses (time, money)**

"But not you, you are committed. You really want to change."

**Confess to being guilty of not having signed up earlier.**

"I can't believe how much time I lost. I'm not going to let you down. Here, sign up."

### 🌺 #4 Get them into the feeling of achieving their hopes and needs

**Make them take a decision and commit to signing up NOW**

Don't ask. Be straight. (keep rapport)

**"Who else do you think wants to come**?"

## 🐍 BONUS: Anthony Robbins recommends these 4 questions, if they are not sure whether it is worth buying

1.  "Do you want to continue like this?" (**pain**)

2\. "Do you want to change and get what you want?" (**pleasure**)

3\. "How **would you feel** if you had changed already? What if it worked? Would it be worth it?"

4\. "Remember when you **made a good decision**? What if it was the same right now?" (you make them process)

Do 1000 push-ups on a single day

📆 I learned a lot about energy allocation that day. I realized that I shouldn’t immediately start doing 20 pushups without rest. When I do that, I reach my limit too quickly, and my muscles are exhausted.
