Ironman 70.3. CONFIRMATION INFORMATION

**It's official.** I will attend the Ironman 70.3 in [Zell am See-Kaprun, Austria.](https://www.ironman.com/im703-zell-am-see)

In the summer of 2022, I attended [my first triathlon](/olympic-triathlon/) in Zuerich.

I have an [Impossible List](/impossiblelist/), where I track and tick off things that may seem impossible at first sight. Still on there: Ironman 70.3. Not for long anymore, hehe.

#### The Ironman 70.3 is a half-Ironman and consists of the following disciplines:

*   Swimming 1.9km (1.2 miles)
*   Cycling 90km (56 miles)
*   Run 21.1km (13.1 miles)

The "70.3" refers to the total distance in miles covered in the race.

### 👨‍🎓 Why participate?

As described in my [last blog post](/30-days-30-episodes/), motivation comes after achievement, not vice versa.

With the motivation and discipline I created after attending the [Vipassana Meditation Seminar](/what-meditating-over-100-hours-this-month-has-taught-me/), I was in state. Following Tony Robbins advice, I took action when I was in state and registered for the Ironman 70.3 in Zell am See, Austria.

### 💪 My current form

**Swimming:** I didn't do more than a little splashing around during the summer, so this is my main focus for the next few days. I will attend the swimming practice too.

**Cycling:** Something I have been doing only in the gym. I will get a bike this week to cross country as the course in Zell am See has 900m elevation gain, and I want to adjust to that.

**Running:** My best discipline. I will not invest much energy and time in preparation.

Official Swim Practice I will attend

### 🧰 Equipment

Focusing only on the essential equipment was very important for my first triathlon in 2022. I don't need expensive gadgets, just the basics.

**I don't have a bike. I need a bike. I will buy a bike.**

Renting a bike at the Ironman 70.3 in Zell am See is not an option. Honestly and sadly the prices are too damn high.

For 325 Euros, I can buy myself a nice race-bike on eBay. I still have some days till the race starts.

Swimming (blue line) and running (purple line)

> The one-loop 90 km (56 mile) bike course offers steep climbs and fast descents. Just before the spectacular climb up the Hochkönig you'll have a chance to replenish your energy reserves thanks to the new aid station.
