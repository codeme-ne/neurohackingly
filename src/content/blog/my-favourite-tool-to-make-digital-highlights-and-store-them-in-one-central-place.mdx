I love making digital highlights and notes of things that resonate with me.

And since I love making digital highlights and notes of things that resonate with me, I have a handful of tools I use repeatedly. They have become part of my daily habit, and I recommend them to anyone and everyone.

## Here are my favorite tools to make digital highlights and notes of things that resonate with me:

**#1. Readwise**

Never forget what you have highlighted.

[Readwise](https://readwise.io/i/lukas095) connects with and **saves highlights** from your favorite reading apps like Kindle or Shortform. You will **regularly receive highlights** you made in the past via email.

[Readwise](https://readwise.io/i/lukas095) uses spaced repetition. It shows you your highlights in timely spaced intervals. (one day, one week, etc.)

**#2. Reader**

[Reader](https://read.readwise.io/) will connect to your Readwise account.

Readwise then exports your highlights to your [favourite note-taking app](/my-favourite-apps/). There you can change your highlights for your own needs.

In this graphic, you can see what [Reader](https://read.readwise.io/) can do.

If you end up using these tools, let me know what you think!
