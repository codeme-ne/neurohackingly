Hello Friend 👋

This week, I want to share some fascinating productivity insights and practical tools that can make your work life smoother and more enjoyable.

### ✅ The Menu Principle: A Fresh Take on To-Do Lists

I recently watched [an insightful video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maG5Q0EG7ik) by time management expert Oliver Burkeman that introduced a game-changing perspective on to-do lists.

Instead of viewing your to-do list as a burden that needs to be completed all at once, treat it like a restaurant menu:

*   You don't order everything on a restaurant menu at once.
*   Similarly, you don't need to tackle every task simultaneously.
*   Your to-do list becomes a collection of possibilities rather than obligations.

### 📅 Justin Welsh's [Weekly Review Framework](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/justinwelsh_on-fridays-i-do-a-weekly-preview-for-next-activity-7197068618725998592-OuBW)

Justin Welsh shared an excellent set of questions he asks himself every Friday to optimize his upcoming week:

1.  What can I remove from my calendar?
2.  What on my calendar can be automated?
3.  What on my calendar can I delegate?
4.  Is there anything that's not important?
5.  Can any meetings be 50% shorter?
6.  How can I get off the computer more?
7.  How can I maximize fun time?
8.  Is there anything missing?

### 🧑‍💻 3 productivity-boosting tools and tips, (primarily for Windows users)

1\. Google Docs Quick Access

Pro tip: Type "docs.new" in your browser's address bar to instantly create a new Google Doc. Check out the post [Top 10 Google Docs Tips for Productivity](https://www.jeffsu.org/top-10-google-docs-tips-for-productivity/), from Jeff Su.

2\. Windows Clipboard Manager

For Windows 10 & 11 users: Access your last 25 clipboard items by pressing **Windows + V**. Pinned items persist even after restart.
