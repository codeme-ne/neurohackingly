I wouldn't call myself an expert in State Management.

However, I have spent probably over 300 hours learning about State Management. And I have probably **spent 1,000**, **hours practicing State Management in my own life.**

## 🕺 Here's how I first got interested in Discovering my Peak State

It was back when I did my Mental Coach Training and [Neuro-linguistic Programming (NLP) Practitioner.](/first-practitioner-getting-started-first-steps-for-dummies/)

From the first moment on, our Trainer showed us how to get into the state we desired. How fast? With a flick. When? Now!

Then came the absolute highlight: [Unleash The Power Within.](https://www.tonyrobbins.com/stories/unleash-the-power/what-is-upw/)

😵 I wrote a whole post on [My Personal Top 10 Takeaways From Tony Robbin's 50-Hour-Long NLP Seminar "Unleash The Power Within" That Will Completely Transform Your Energy, Focus, and Drive.](/nlp-seminar-unleash-the-power-within-10-takeaways/)

I was a little skeptical at first; however, after the first day, I felt the impact the event already had on me.

### 🪓 Breakthrough

Not only did I break through a wooden board.

The aftereffects lasted for months. In the upcoming months, I overcame fears that I had been actively fighting for years.

**Less thinking, more doing. That's what I learned. Just do.**

## Managing My State: My goal over the next week is to end suffering

Tony Robbins has a ritual. He does not go into a suffering state for more than 90 seconds. If he does, he will act quickly to get into a beautiful state again.

Since I'm not quite at that level yet, I'll start with 150 seconds for the next 7 days.

🌻

What are your favourite techniques to get yourself into a beautiful state?
