Hello friend 👋🏼

I'll make it quick and painless: **I'm taking a break. ⏸**

"Really? Can it be any more dramatic?" Sorry, I had to ...

## 😫 But why?

I've been spending a lot of time on creating this blog, Podcast, YouTube, and Newsletter lately. And please don't get me wrong, it's **something that's really close to my heart** and I have spent working on writing, recording and researching often till deep into the night. Not because I had to, but because I really enjoy it.

## 💡 My realization

However, lately, I have realized that I have to set priorities. **The time I spend creating content, I take from other areas of my life.** The piece of cake that I took from the other areas of my life has unfortunately caused me some uncomfortable feelings that had been in the back of my head. At least that is my theory.

My old wheel of life and my new wheel of life [(more](https://www.thecoachingtoolscompany.com/wheel-of-life-complete-guide-everything-you-need-to-know/) on the wheel of life)

Also, I have the most profound **respect** for all **creators and people who want to go in the direction of creating something.** How do you separate your private and "creating" life? Or is it the same?

## 🥰 Grateful

Maybe, you know what I am talking about. Maybe, you have even been in a similar situation. **If you have any thoughts, inspiration, or even some little advice that pops up in your mind, I would definitely appreciate it.**

👋🏼 Baba, bye and auf wiederluege,

We'll be in touch,  
Lukas
