Our skin is the largest organ of our bodies and serves as the first line of defense against the outside world.

Healthy skin not only helps us look good but also protects us from infections, regulates body temperature, and allows us to feel sensations. Therefore, taking care of your skin is essential for overall health.

**In this week's issue 📨**

I'll share my simple daily skincare routine along with some advanced therapies that I use to keep my skin in top condition.

## Importance of Personalized Measurement

My skin ranges from dry to oily, generally normal except for my T-zone, which is normal to oily.

My Skin Analysis

I tried the [Derma Reader from Kiehl's](https://www.loreal.com/en/articles/science-and-technology/derma-reader/) which I liked, considering that they do it for free. However, I recommend getting a professional skin analysis with a device like VISIA. Just google "VISIA skincare analysis near me" and you should find clinics offering a comprehensive skin analysis for under €100.

I will definitely try [Visia by Canfield](https://www.canfieldsci.com/imaging-systems/visia-complexion-analysis/) in the future.

## Nutrition’s Role in Skincare

A crucial element in my skincare is nutrition and sleep.

**Products and foods I consume to improve skin health:**

*   Daily vegetables and fruits (foods rich in antioxidants)
*   Oils from flax seeds, hemp seeds, and Omega-3/6 supplements
*   Collagen peptides (15 g) (doi: [10.3390/nu11051079](https://doi.org/10.3390%2Fnu11051079)) although experts like [Bryan Johnson recommend even higher doses](https://protocol.bryanjohnson.com/Home), ranging from 20–30 grams
*   Niacinamide (15 mg) and Hyaluronic Acid (120 mg)
*   Prioritizing sleep

## My Daily Skincare Routine

_Note:_ [_Bryan Johnson’s advice_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nuzf0FxO94) _to skincare is that creams don’t shift the needle, devices do._

### My Morning Routine

*   [UVA+B mineral sunscreen](https://amzn.to/3YfUU5W) provides strong protection and covers red spots well, despite its thick consistency

### My Evening Routine

I switched from Paula’s Choice to CeraVe. Considering their low price, I rate CeraVe 8 out of 10.

*   Face Wash: [Acne Control Cleanser](https://www.amazon.de/-/en/Cleansing-Foaming-against-Blemished-Niacinamide/dp/B0B7RQ46LD/ref=sr_1_2?crid=1S4GGBEGTK6AO&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.1uE1uFLCSH5hW8t0Bo8SzdBB-Wlk763W-t8u9og8EcyNGqaapIlpS3-zbrgLsxAAlqdIOw-alheZa02SRdtNM-J6vQxCA6aQRV7t8m8IL8IlLYC8gaT8CQfdbtWbB7r77fuOY_uof147tn55Jx9gyW3BhV0pCdZW1qAmw_izkqd4xLi5EPNZBeAoI4xi0pgYXh7-MOG0bkpX_825Ucr7R8evvnNeR2rMHRFrc20t-cQ7Ic2tJDip6K95biIo-5tlNMW1RrWPM-OlNbUJINY495Fj5bj1Da7R8DkOt-59zxk.GzUuqeXALa7mQoJWBDaaIWsP4Qru5iQ5kjiTW-jKX6U&dib_tag=se&keywords=CeraVe+Acne+Control+Cleanser&qid=1720450344&sprefix=cerave+acne+control+cleanser%2Caps%2C137&sr=8-2) (salicylic acid 2%)
*   Moisturizer Face: [Moisturising Night Cream](https://www.amazon.de/-/en/CeraVe-Moisturising-Night-Cream-52/dp/B07C5XYT19/ref=sr_1_7?crid=29XN2WSMVDXPI&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.sFpK8QiEvSp0CFKtU0SZ9jQ1Nn80piaqAF0v-sYUFGob3zTik95VxvdqkqACduWHB0vCnBA3XY0gRAGrERDaQ1eBmCtRaEBYK_WKCm4U0KBm4_rFNYGKiK3FnVLVIJPhfddUazdQTPxwiNAKtVe70N3z7HV5JJ4rOp7KmuUbmsePnQC4JQIGUCvBvBejMmxDDM7NJuskjPtqw8A7AmEsWV4c7QUXrXm9D53jTh55O6GtiuEfqF8J8AASeny_ZKxot20qAu1Th7hj14BvvaMqJ7NCDfAZ9UVg3PPZbgT3raA.xnC4YX_AzyuO3Tq3pVKGy5ktpJI1ezMLDIrzPLoVGFo&dib_tag=se&keywords=CeraVe%2BFacial%2BMoisturizing%2BLotion&qid=1720450366&sprefix=cerave%2Bfacial%2Bmoisturizing%2Blotion%2Caps%2C93&sr=8-7&th=1)
*   Moisturizer Body: [Moisturizing Cream for Body](https://www.amazon.de/-/en/MB517700/dp/B0CBKWWHY9/ref=sr_1_8?crid=1IHT1TM9507RS&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.DxetWW4JO7p_usvFhvH5LYDdtg2fYPsyhqG6pe5m3p_kyLrLT1nbgEd5IBgc020sVDc0AeVHwPj6k0HkN2SWmx-uOEX_q1olKd1JilXOWjWZH1niYjLA_PsR3Prhq44GO6snt0N3lgbcGbanC4a6tHzd053YUl25YthWIK0zu4icF-SXaUnl7eRtim0akd4g1HneyPiGRU7_qKBI6Vj7vz2hwA-uR-valxsyP3ppoEi1JhLKZpXmMiFpqAdf1ysKmmIuB_SOoF4DCNmduxdTpdL9wnolyVFkWY2ALPmDZHA.Xim6AhTjUzCp4HooKW-Gt_2U7UTqYk7500PwVr9bC3M&dib_tag=se&keywords=Moisturizing+Cream+Body&qid=1720450455&sprefix=moisturizing+cream+body%2Caps%2C126&sr=8-8) (take care of the whole body skin 😄)
*   Tretinoin (prescription)

> "Retinoids reduce fine lines and wrinkles by increasing the production of collagen. They also stimulate the production of new blood vessels in the skin, which improves skin color. Additional benefits include fading age spots and softening rough patches of skin." - [Harvard Health](https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/do-retinoids-really-reduce-wrinkles)

*   Other creams: **Vitamin C, E, ferulic, B3, azelaic acid.** Option 1: [SkinCeuticals](https://www.skinceuticals.com/skincare/vitamin-c-serums/c-e-ferulic-with-15-l-ascorbic-acid/S17.html) (€168), Option 2: [Timeless](https://amzn.to/3YhQRWK) (€34)

* * *

### Things I Am Trying Out

*   Non-bleeding microneedling with [DermaPen](https://www.amazon.de/-/en/DermaPen-Derma-Roller-Microfine-Pen/dp/B07B2RYSPB/ref=sr_1_5?crid=10FBPXJJM0RXY&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.cDrKPLtSoW1MA8bowojZ-LRwhq3EBtHpO4fu5qVyQ-kS3hydV9GxlgUXrG1EYaby1nZ1TO8xcBTkeTOk-fGnkhSwbXk78c-9HQrvxr6DmNEHXTE6U2NAJq8fu6H1Jes0AQyfo2t8Hxbt4ifV6KmWSltOUYYb3fabpqhGV10daoGFEO_8Ymr7hf25Ay6_8ndLToaR0CvbC_X3zJ1q-SHqF5bJOvoiN7-0HYIcIXk55zzCgHMqWRwoslYdA84FO32GyTaS-TDE7Ot_1ucn9D7UezSAmjBZIGwjoESlhShhhoQ.GcN7N9ScSiLjuCUVQ_sUYZ8aDr3gsv4rTGGLxlLJ9ls&dib_tag=se&keywords=microneedling%2Bpen&qid=1720455279&sprefix=microneedling%2Bpen%2Caps%2C99&sr=8-5&th=1) and HA serum
*   Red-light therapy: Red and near-infrared light therapy significantly improves skin complexion, reduces wrinkles and increases collagen density → strengthen skin's structure, making it firmer and more elastic (doi: [10.1089/pho.2013.3616](https://doi.org/10.1089%2Fpho.2013.3616))
*   Sauna and ice baths for blood flow

* * *

## Summary

**Personalized Skincare Analysis**: Try professional analysis with VISIA for detailed insights on your skin.

**Nutrition and Supplements**: Have a diet rich in antioxidants, essential oils, collagen peptides, niacinamide, hyaluronic acid, and prioritze sleep.

**Daily and Advanced Skincare Routine**: I use products like CeraVe, tretinoin, and mineral sunscreen, along with advanced therapies such as non-bleeding microneedling, red-light therapy, and sauna/ice baths.

Have a great week! 

xx Lukas
