👋 Hello Friend

If you want to get more done while working less, you should check out the book [_Rest_](https://www.amazon.de/Rest-More-Done-When-Work/dp/0241217296/ref=sr_1_1?crid=6TVTA39Z41I9&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.wFQckVmEf7IH21i6QfasF7pNHjuqYRZEmn8hy4sY01tUnmXI-iC57y58bLdp9WgAktlD2BmTPEw2Rx9weorF_Nr5MhGfeRgdiwP9pnLCxGCz0c54DHp9Fn2CfnUnW-jZvuyRN6xEYJ1Fhq5tnktlRvaTQAmrIwqzAJIyadZdFUcH8TYyaoqSozj4yLhCL9HsCSC4qJT5epY6p6eZMOGXLiYH5lvvmleUm-sS6dpZbdM.dDJsyVYZDJJGVlU215c0SkLPsaBmqKecB6E7Z8yu5vE&dib_tag=se&keywords=rest+alex+soojung&qid=1724688339&sprefix=rest+alex%2Caps%2C172&sr=8-1) by Alex Soojung-Kim Pang.

**📕 I (try to) not just read books; I take action on the information I consume.**

_Rest_ taught me that rest is something active and deliberate.

> "Deliberate rest is not a negative space defined by the absence of work or something that we hope to get sometime." –Alex Soojung-Kim Pang

**⏰ My day now starts with early deep work (6am).** In the afternoon I do activities like walking and napping.

**Last week I had the following routine:**

*   wake up at 6 a.m.
*   eat a protein bar & drink a coffee
*   deep work for 3-5 hours

—like Scott Adams, the creator of [_Dilbert_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dilbert).

* * *

**⏲️ _Rest_ covers a whole chapter why 4h focused work / day is ideal to maximize productivity.**

Poincaré, the nineteenth century’s most towering mathematical genius, _"did his hardest thinking between 10 a.m. and noon, and again between five and seven in the afternoon,"_ . He worked 4 hours a day.

* * *

**🚶 After some hours of focused work, Nobel Prize Winner in Physics Eugene Wigner takes a walk.**

> "Once outside, my mind immediately begins to move freely and instinctively over my subject. Ideas come rushing to my mind, without being called." – Eugene Wigner

Paul Dirac echoed this by stating, _"I would not intentionally think about my work"_ during these walks.

🔗 More the subject: [The Diffused Mode: How to Solve a Difficult Problem](/the-diffused-mode-how-to-solve-a-difficult-problem/).

Sara Mednick discovered that by balancing sleep pressure, circadian rhythm, and sleep type you can tailor a nap to your needs:

*   **🤡 Creative stimulation**: 1-hour nap taken 5 hours after waking.
*   **🏎️ Mental recharge without feeling groggy**: 20-minute nap taken 6 hours after waking.
*   **🤸 Physical restoration**: 1-hour nap taken 7 hours after waking.

The main takeaway from the “Sleep” and “Nap” chapters: **No sleep is lost time!**

* * *

I don’t know what you will do now, but I’m going to take a nap and enjoy some deliberate rest for the rest of the day. 😴

**Have a restful week!**
