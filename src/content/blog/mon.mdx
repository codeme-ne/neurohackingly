It's been some time.

I can't remember the last time I wrote a blog post.

Inspired by Derek Sivers.

I love browsing [sive.rs](sive.rs)

I love browsing posts on [/tech](https://sive.rs/tech)

I am interesten in how he uses his phone. What's his setup?

Meh, probably not important for him.

Hardware, Software, Services are impressive. [/uses](sive.rs/uses)

Less = I like

I don't know what fascinates me so much about him.

I guess it's staying true to yourself no matter what others do.

It inspires.

In one blog article, I could identify particularly well.

Derek talks about how he likes to be alone. Being with another person for 2-3 hours is enough to drain his social batteries.

**Ideal day?**

From 6 a.m. to 10 p.m., engrossed in his hobby. His passion.

A short break for exercise between.

But otherwise alone. Doing what he enjoys.

I feel it.

I've already started a digital conversion after reading this article from him.

The first thing I'm going to do is disable Google Analytics.

Why did I finally start this blog?

To find out more about myself.

To write my random thoughts.

That's something I've completely lost sight of in the last few months.

It was more about which topics resonated with my newsletter readers.

I changed my question.

Now it is: What random topic is on my mind & what do I want to write about?

So, Derek, if you're reading this... Thank you.
