## ❌ A common misconception about personal development coaching is that as a coach, you must have better knowledge of the client's field

They should not be confused with a consultant who provides advice and strategies.

A coach is also not a clinical psychologist; a clinical psychologist works with people with illnesses or other mental health concerns. However, a **coach works only with healthy people.**

## 🚀 Why should you even bother getting a coach?

✅ **Clarify** your goals and vision.

✅ An **actionable plan** to make the vision a reality.

✅ **New possibilities** for action and thoughts emerge that the client did not have access to before.

✅ **Faster achievement** of the result you want (if it is a good coach, also work towards what fulfills you).

✅ **It's the** **2% that differentiates the excellent from the outstanding** - a coach can make this tiny difference.
