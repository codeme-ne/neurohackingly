👋 Hello friend

In June 2024, I had a comprehensive blood test with 65 markers to get an accurate overview of my state of health.

Four months later, this Wednesday, I am due to have another blood test. Since the first blood test, I have **started to integrate supplements into my routine.**

## 💊Why am I supplementing at all?

My diet was already at a very good level - a 9/10, I would say.

I exercise five times a week and walk an average of 10,000 steps a day. My sleep is also solid, although there is still room for improvement. So I optimized the three main pillars of sport, nutrition and sleep before I turned to supplements.

💡

This is an experience report. As everyone is individual, I don't want to make any recommendations, but simply share what works for me.

## 👀My daily supplement routine at a glance

In the morning I start with Nutty Pudding, a protein powder with soy milk, dried blueberries and macadamia nuts. At the moment I use the [pre-made version from Bryan Johnson](https://protocol.bryanjohnson.com/#step-2-supplements), but I usually make it fresh myself.

I then drink Bryan Johnson's Longevity Mix and take 8 of his recommended capsules.

**🥛Longevity Mix:** My personal favorite! With ingredients such as creatine, glucosamine, ashwagandha and L-glutathione, it supports the muscles, brain, joints, liver and immune system.  
**💊NAC + Turmeric + Ginger:** This blend is simple and effective - with just three ingredients that have a positive effect on the liver, lungs, digestion, joints and anti-inflammation.  
**💊Red Yeast Rice + Odor-Free Garlic:** Supports cardiovascular health and the immune system.  
**💊Essential Softgel:** Contains important nutrients such as vitamin K, astaxanthin and lutein for bones, heart, eyes and skin.  
**💊Multivitamins/Essential Capsules:** Lots of ingredients, which is why I proceeded cautiously and ordered most of the ingredients individually from Amazon, eBay or other vendors to feel my way in gradually.

### Additional supplements:

*   Collagen (12.5g)
*   Inulin (probiotic, 2.8g)
*   Fish oil (EPA & DHA, 2000mg)
*   Iron (12.5mg)
*   [Whey Protein Isolate](https://amzn.to/3A5x9FP) from edubily (extreme high quality)
*   [EAA Powder](https://amzn.to/4e6Vf0L) from edubily (extreme high quality)

According to Bryan Johnson, his supplement stack is designed for each person and provides clinically relevant doses of each ingredient.

I take [300mcg of melatonin](https://www.lifeextensioneurope.de/melatonin-300-mcg) in the evening. Most melatonin supplements are grossly overdosed at 1mg or more, which leads to extreme fatigue for me the next day. 300mcg is perfect for me and according to Oura measurements, it helps me get more deep and REM sleep.

This is an initial overview of my supplement routine. In the future I will go into more detail about the individual components.

Have a great week!
