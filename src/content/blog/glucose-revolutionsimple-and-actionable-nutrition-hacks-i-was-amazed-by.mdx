[Glucose Revolution](https://amzn.to/3t2CUQn): The life-changing power of balancing your blood sugar (german edition)

**Our nutrition and thus, glucose level plays a big part in how energized we feel throughout the day.**

Maybe you think: _"I have a reasonably healthy diet, why do I still have a schnitzel coma after lunch and need coffee to keep me alive?"_ (I certainly did, before reading [Glucose Revolution](https://amzn.to/3Llhh43) by Jessie Inchauspe)

🎢 The glucose curve of many people (including me) resembles a roller coaster.

#### A flat glucose curve without outliers should be the goal. This has the following advantages:

*   better sleep
*   constant energy
*   elevated mood
*   no hot hunger attacks
*   clearer skin

## 5 Simple the book [Glucose Revolution](https://amzn.to/3t2CUQn) has taught me

### 👉🏼 The best order to eat your food is fiber. Then proteins and fats. At the end, starch and sugar.

Order matters.

**Foods containing Fibre (**vegetables)

*   spinach
*   mushrooms
*   tomatoes
*   zucchini
*   artichoke
*   sauerkraut
*   lentils
*   lettuce

**Foods containing Protein**

*   greek yogurt
*   tofu
*   meat
*   fish
*   cheese
*   protein powder
*   nuts
*   seeds
*   eggs

**Foods containing Fats**

*   butter
*   olive oil
*   avocado
*   chia & flax seeds
*   nut butter

**Optional: Foods containing starch and sugar**

*   fruit
*   oats
*   toast
*   rice
*   potatoes

### 🍹 Drink a glass of water with a tablespoon of vinegar before your meal.

### 💃🏼 Move after you eat. (up to 70 minutes after)

This allows your muscles to consume excess glucose, which would otherwise result in a glucose spike.

### 🍫 A muesli bar is not an optimal snack. Try this these snack ideas instead.

Compare the glucose curve of the first graph after eating a muesli bar with the second graph after eating carrots and peanut butter.

"For a stable glucose level, choose snacks that won't cause a spike." Like carrots, cucumbers, and peanut butter.

#### Simple and tasty snack ideas from Glucose Revolution:

*   One cup of Greek yogurt mixed with some Nut butter
*   A handful of baby carrots with a tablespoon of hummus
*   A handful of macadamia nuts and a piece of dark chocolate (90% cocoa)
*   Apple slices with a piece of cheese
*   Bell pepper strips with guacamole dip
*   Celery dipped in nut butter
*   A handful of pork rind chips
*   A hard boiled egg with a drizzle of chili sauce
*   Lightly salted coconut chips
*   Sesame crackers with a slice of cheese

### 🍳 Eat something hearty for breakfast.

Avoid foods high in starch and sugar, like cornflakes, bagels and porridge. Consume your carbs with other high-protein or high-fat foods.
