In today's world, we take so much for granted. We have everything in overflow. Especially our thoughts. **A human being has about 60.000 thoughts per day - and 90% of these are repetitive, according to the research of Dr. Fred Luskin.** Next time when you feel stressed and don't know what to do because you have so many thoughts racing through your brain, hold your breath and try not to breathe. I promise that you will only have one thought.  

## Cold Therapy

The Wim Hof Method is a breathing technique that was developed by the dutch "Iceman" who holds several world records. As a young adult, he lost his beloved wife and thus started to treat his loss with cold therapy. He dug a hole into a frozen lake and sat in the freezing water for several minutes. He realized that when the body is exposed to the cold he does not think of his wife but just about how to survive.

Some month ago I attended a Wim Hof Workshop in Thun, Switzerland. Although I did not beat **Wim Hof's record of being exposed to ice for 1 hour, 52 minutes and 42 seconds** I was very pleased with the result of 2 minutes.

## Wim Hof Method breathing technique

Wim Hof developed a special breathing method that is great for getting more energy. It also helps you if you want to relax or fall asleep faster. Here you will find a guided breathing session with the Iceman.

The Wim Hof Method

  
Cold therapy and breath work is something that complements each other very well. It is like meditation because it lets me focus on myself, my body and my breath. This is when I am the most relaxed and have great ideas and thoughts that pop into my mind.

Are you interested in challenging yourself? If yes, then feel free to look at [my Impossible list](/31daychallenge/), where I try out **31 challenges in 31 days.**
