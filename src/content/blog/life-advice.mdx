👋 Hello friend

Journaling and Meditation are performed by close to 100% of people that bestselling author Tim Ferris interviewed for his book [**Tools of Titans**](https://amzn.to/3IAEYmL)

**Tim Ferris interviewed over 200 billionaires, icons, and world-class performers** to analyze and distill their strategies, routines, and habits.

## 🔆 4 unique questions to journal on:

#### **🤯 #1. Am I being busy or productive?**

The lion hunting field mice may get little snacks; however, he will sooner or later die, feeling good for just a short time with an illusion of temporary accomplishment.

#### **😡 #2. What makes me angry?**

This is an outstanding question to ask oneself when feeling mentally stuck. (e.g., writer's block)

#### **👹 #3. What can I learn from the people I hate the most?**

"If you hate a person, you hate something in him that is part of yourself. What isn’t part of ourselves doesn’t disturb us." - Hermann Hesse

#### **🤑 #4. How might some of my biggest weaknesses be strengths or assets?**

## 💬 2 inspirational quotes to live by (by Derek Sivers)

> Don't be a donkey. - Derek Sivers

You can do almost anything you want in life, just not all simultaneously.

This story is about a donkey who is very thirsty and hungry at the same time. There is water on one side and hay on the other. The donkey cannot think sequentially and long term. He wants the water AND the hay. In the end, the donkey dies - thirsty and hungry.

**Most people overestimate what they can do in one year and underestimate what they can do in ten years.**

Think long-term. Don't be a donkey.

> If more information were the answer we'd all be billionaires with six-pack abs. - Derek Sivers

Just reading, watching, and listening more isn't enough.

When we look at successful people, we often think they have a secret recipe that got them where they are. Looking closer, we see that the difference is that extraordinary people can make themselves take action, compared to the average person.
