**31 Insane + Nice Things I Will Do In The Next Coming Weeks**

## 🚀 Impossible Things completed, which brought me out of my comfort zone

I've had a **bucket list and every year a new vision board** for quite some time now. I have been collecting new Challenges on them for quite some time now.

Enclosed you will find some of the things I have done this year. (2022)

*   [Running a marathon (without any training)](/podcast/how-to-run-a-marathon-without-any-training-2/)
*   [Europe's highest bungee jump (220meters)](/podcast/europes-highest-bungee-jump-how-to-expand-your-comfort-zone/)
*   [Olympic Triathlon: 8 Things You Have To Know](/podcast/olympic-triathlon/)

> _The only thing that’s keeping you from getting what you want is the story you keep telling yourself. -Tony Robbins_

* * *

🎯 I'm doing this because I want to get myself **out of my comfort zone.** I also find it great for **prioritization and focusing on only one thing a day.**

You can learn more about this challenge on my [YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCOPBNUSX_4Z7l2Qc-FYMS3g) and your favorite [podcast](/podcast/) app. I made 2 podcast episodes, where I specifically talk about **how to get out of your comfort zone and embrace a challenge.** 💪🏼

I have written down **31 items out of 4 categories:**

1.  Items that are on my **vision board,** which I created this year and didn't do until now.
2.  Some tasks I have been **postponing for weeks/months.**
3.  **30-day challenges** I chunked down to 1-day challenges because I would otherwise be overwhelmed by them. Like [these 30-day experiments](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4D0HRrl2P1o&list=PLXKuahfdkl6zkBULJhEMNy_RnErOYXwJk) from Matt D'Avella.
4.  Things I thought of when I read the **blog post [**"Top Five Regrets of the dying"**](https://bronnieware.com/blog/regrets-of-the-dying/).**

#### Top 5 Regrets of the dying

The [5 regrets of the dying](https://bronnieware.com/blog/regrets-of-the-dying/) was written by a nurse who counseled the dying in their last days and revealed the ****most common regrets we have at the end of our lives.****

Common themes surfaced again and again, which are:

1\. I wish I'd had the courage to live a life true to myself, not the life others expected of me.

2\. I wish I hadn't worked so hard.

3\. I wish I'd had the courage to express my feelings.

4\. I wish I had stayed in touch with my friends.

5\. I wish that I had let myself be happier.
