### **☑️ The Checklist Manifesto -** [**Shortform**](http://shortform.com/neurohackingly)

This weeks summary to read was The Checklist Manifesto. 

I am in the process of writing everyday checklists. 

> "But while training and experience are important, expertise can’t eliminate human fallibility. What’s needed is a different strategy for preventing failure that takes advantage of knowledge and experience but also compensates for human flaws. The solution is a checklist." - The Checklist Manifesto on [Shortform](https://www.shortform.com/?utm_source=neurohackingly&utm_medium=partner)

> "In complex environments, checklists can help to prevent failure by addressing two problems:  
>   
> 1\. Our memory and attention to detail fail when we’re distracted by more urgent matters.  
> 2\. People have a tendency to skip steps even when they remember them." - The Checklist Manifesto on [Shortform](https://www.shortform.com/?utm_source=neurohackingly&utm_medium=partner)

> "Boeing’s flight deck designer, Daniel Boorman, is an expert on checklists. Before creating a checklist, he recommends two things:  
> 1) Define a clear ‘“pause point” or logical break in the workflow at which the checklist is to be used.  
> 2) Decide whether to create a Do-Confirm list or a Read-Do list." - The Checklist Manifesto on [Shortform](https://www.shortform.com/?utm_source=neurohackingly&utm_medium=partner)

Have a great week! 🌱
