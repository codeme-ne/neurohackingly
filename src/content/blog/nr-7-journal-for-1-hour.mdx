![Template in Notion where you can see the dates of my journal entries, but not the content](/content/images/2022/10/image-1.png)

I had a diary template in Notion for a long time, for which I took **no more than 3 minutes every morning and evening.** I usually answered it after waking up and before sleeping in bed.

Check out the [current journaling template](https://neurohackingly.notion.site/neurohackingly/Great-Day-by-neurohackingly-0dd1883ae3314089b479a5778a843119) I created on Notion.

🧭 What did it help me to do? To reflect on my thoughts and feelings and consciously control my focus.

🐏 If you wonder why I asked myself, "What did I dream?" - at the time, as I experimented with Lucid Dreaming.
