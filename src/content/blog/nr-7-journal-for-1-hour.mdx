![Template in Notion where you can see the dates of my journal entries, but not the content](/images/nr-7-journal-for-1-hour/image-1.png)

I had a diary template in Notion for a long time, for which I took **no more than 3 minutes every morning and evening.** I usually answered it after waking up and before sleeping in bed.

Check out the [current journaling template](https://neurohackingly.notion.site/neurohackingly/Great-Day-by-neurohackingly-0dd1883ae3314089b479a5778a843119) I created on Notion.

🧭 What did it help me to do? To reflect on my thoughts and feelings and consciously control my focus.

🐏 If you wonder why I asked myself, "What did I dream?" - at the time, as I experimented with Lucid Dreaming.

Feel free to copy the 3 min journal template from [https://valentinperez.com/](https://valentinperez.com/).

## Morning 🌞

**What did I dream?**

**Three things I am grateful for**

**Looking forward to**

**What under my control would make today even more great**

**Idea for Experiment to Run**

**If I lived even more consciously, freely, and courageously, I would:**

**I am**

**The Most Important Thing to Focus On**

## Night 🌛

**Three Wins**

**One thing I learned** is that it is a breakthrough idea (link to page for those).

**One thing I could have done to make today better: how can I apply it tomorrow?** Something I could have said better?

**Am I resisting something?** What?

**What is my favorite thing of my day?**

**Short story of a moment today:**

**Experiment/hypothesis from today?**

**What could I do tomorrow that is High Leverage?** High/boundless upside, low downside.

**Request for the subconscious mind to sleep on.**
