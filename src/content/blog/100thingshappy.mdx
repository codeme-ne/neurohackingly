Today, every free second of thought, my mind was searching for things that make me happy. At the end of the day I wanted to have a list of 100 Things that Make me Happy.

We control our focus. We decide wether we think about the little enjoyable moments or the things we still have to get done today.

Throughout the day I noticed my state change. Because I focused on thebeautiful things and felt grateful I had great ideas, more clarity and focus.

Accordingly, I have also noticed how my focus shifted.

How often do we get up and the first bad thoughts already start to creep in: "Such crappy weather again. Man, now I missed the train."

Because I wanted to finish the list of 100 Things That Make Me Happy, I didn't just actively ask myself the question: What makes me happy? I also engaged my subconscious every second of the day.

Sometimes I believe, **you only have to know how to use something FOR you.**

To control your focus, you have to ask the right question. As Tony Robbins always says so beautifully:

> Where focus goes, energy flows.

I actively asked myself at every point, "Is it really making me happy?"

E.g. watching Youtube - I first thought to myself, "Yeah, sure. That's where I can really relax and be happy." After thinking about it for a while, however, I realized that it's **actually more of a habit and I actually feel drained after watching Youtube Videos.**

The cool thing about this list is that I now have it hanging on my door and whenever I'm not feeling so good, I can look at it and it reminds me that I have **100 (!!!!) things** **I can do at any time to feel at least a little happier.** Funnily enough, a pattern has emerged from this as well...

🔝

Especially food, sports, friends, and family came up a lot. Also gaining experiences and adventures.

Now taped to my door to hopefully always leave with a smile 😉

An expensive Porsche and the matching gold chain are not on top (probably also because I can't afford either of them). Well, there is always room for improvement ;)

Last but not least, I noticed that I started the list with "big" things like food, friends, and psychology, but then finished with smaller things like the burger restaurant in Kloten, or the great view and feeling I get when I climb the summit after a strenuous hike. **No generalizations, but concrete events.** Interesting.

Also, the flight with an MD82 to Rhodes somehow popped up in my head:
