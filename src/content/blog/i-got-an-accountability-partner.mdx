I've noticed for some time that while I strictly follow goals and habits in the first few weeks, there is a point when small exceptions are made, and eventually, piece by piece, everything almost returns to the starting position.

Therefore, me and a good friend decided to have weekly video calls. They consist of following up on our set goals and talking about what to improve in the future.

_No professional coach._

_No money_ _spent._

**Every Tuesday at 7:00 p.m., we have a 20-minute accountability meeting.**

### My favourite Calendar App

I put it in my new favourite calendar app called [Fantastical](https://flexibits.com/fantastical). [Fantastical](https://flexibits.com/fantastical) has Natural language processing. You can write "Write Blogpost about Accountability Partner from 9 am till 10 am tomorrow."

It will then automatically schedule the activity "Write Blogpost about Accountablity Partner" into your calendar from 9 a.m. to 10 a.m. for the day of tomorrow.

### 3 simple Accountability Meeting Questions

*   What went well last week?
*   What would I like to improve?
*   What were my key learnings?

### 3 Simple Daily Goals

*   8h sleep/day
*   Physical Challenge
*   Mental Challenge

More on what is meant by Physical and Mental Challenge later.

Weekly Accountability Template

As my Accountability Buddy and I have the same 3 daily goals, we created a shared template on GoodNotes. This allows us to follow each other's progress between the weekly meetings.

**Physical Challenge:** This can be any activity where you physically challenge yourself, like HIIT training or going for a 10km run.

**Mental Challenge:** I got this idea from [Andrew Huberman](https://hubermanlab.com/guest-series-dr-paul-conti-how-to-understand-and-assess-your-mental-health/). He talks about an activity that is ideally somewhat unpleasant because of the mental effort you have to put in. It is not about reaching a goal but rather about the process of having to use your brain to do a difficult task.

Examples are reading a scientific paper or solving Sodokus.

### 10-second summary

An Accountability Partner helped me stick to my goals over the long term. We track our goals daily via GoodNotes using a synchronized template and have a video call every week. There, we analyze our progress.
