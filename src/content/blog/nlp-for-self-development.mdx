### Foreword

This is the ultimate guide on how you can harness the power of NLP (Neuro-Linguistic Programming) through self-coaching to achieve what you have always dreamed of.

With this guide, you have a resource compactly summarized and specifically distilled to the minimum from over 6 years of NLP experience and thousands of coaching hours. I have invested over 25,000 euros in personal development (especially NLP training) and want to present you with the most powerful methods in this guide.

## My experience with NLP over the last couple of years

**I completed my first NLP Practitioner, Master, and Trainer within 1 1/2 years.**

## NLP for Dummies: 🧠 What is NLP (explained in 4 simple steps)

1.  Immediately and **practically applicable**
2.  NLP or personal development can be **applied to all areas of life** and improve them.
3.  The founders of NLP have chosen and adapted the most helpful psychological methods to achieve the **maximum and fastest success for** coachees.

### NLP is composed of 3 parts: Neuro - Linguistic - Programming

1.  **Neuro** (the nervous system that we use to take in information from the environment)
2.  **Linguistics** (language we use to communicate with others externally and with ourselves internally)
3.  **Programming** (systematic and targeted change)

Thus, with the help of language, processes in the brain and behaviors are changed.

**NLP (neuro-linguistic programming) is the ultimate approach to skyrocket your self-development fast.**

## 🌎 Introduction: What is NLP?

Neuro-linguistic programming (NLP) is a psychological method that focuses on how individuals organize their feelings, thinking, and language. NLP is used as an approach to communication and self-development. It can be used to **achieve desired goals, break negative thinking, and discover your true values.** It has gained significant popularity because it cured lifelong phobias of individuals in a very short time (often in just one session). NLP was created by Richard Bandler and John Grinder in California. NLP has been used by therapists, coaches, and self-help experts for over 40 years and has **helped millions of people worldwide achieve their goals and manage their fears.**

## ✨ The 4 Main Benefits of NLP

In this section, I want to list some the main benefits of practicing NLP.

**1\. NLP helps you to use positive, reflective, and attractive language.**

Did you know we have an inner voice (a submodality) that can influence how we speak to ourselves? For example, you can use the Mickey Mouse Technique, which involves changing the voice in your head (which is most likely dark and deep, at least in my case) to one that sounds like Mickey Mouse. You can find a detailed explanation video on YouTube [.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ehglqjdLoAU) (in german)

**2\. NLP helps you gain inner freedom.**

By understanding and changing how you think, feel, and behave, you can overcome negative patterns and behaviors that may hold you back. This can lead to greater fulfillment and satisfaction in life.

**3\. NLP helps you to have a substantial influence on yourself and others.**

By discovering your strategies for negative patterns, you gain insight into how to change them. You will better understand yourself and your habits through self-reflection exercises and NLP coaching. You can only influence others if you know how to influence yourself first.

**4\. NLP helps you to free yourself from blockages and destructive behaviors.**

By identifying the underlying causes of negative patterns through asking questions, you can break free from them and create lasting change in your life. This can lead to improved health, increased happiness, and more success in all areas of life.

> You need to get to the root of what’s holding you back and cultivate an overall positive mindset that doesn’t ignore negative emotions, but knows how to control them. - Tony Robbins

## How to Practice NLP on Yourself and the Top 3 NLP Techniques

While it is possible to learn NLP on your own, it is often **helpful to get training from an NLP Trainer or coach.**

In addition, attending **workshops and seminars** can be a great way to deepen your understanding of NLP. You will learn NLP in theory and practice in groups with different people. If there is one thing I have learned in the NLP courses I have attended, you have **only truly understood something if you have applied it to practice.**

I personally recommend [Landsiedel](https://www.landsiedel.com/ch/), which is the biggest NLP Institute in Europe. Also, thanks to [Marian Zefferer](https://marianzefferer.at/), I did all my NLP training there (NLP Practitioner, Master, Trainer, and currently the NLP Coach).

### 💛 The most transformative strategies and tools from Tony Robbins: Action-oriented summarized, critically scrutinized and compared with other bestsellers by Shortform

If you want to get back immediate Control of Your Mental, Emotional, Physical and Financial Destiny, [go to Shortform](https://www.shortform.com/?utm_source=neurohackingly&utm_medium=partner) and skim through their powerful summary on the book "Awaken The Giant Within" by Tony Robbins.

Tony Robbins Number #1 Bestseller "Awaken The Giant Within" has 544 pages.

Shortform gives you the most impactful strategies and methods written on just a few pages. Plus, Shortform focuses on getting you to take action with the knowledge you have acquired after reading their summary.

### 🧙🏼‍♂️ How to Practice NLP on Yourself

It is essential to know the theory of the techniques and formats, and NLP has much of that.

**However, NLP mainly lives from the application.** If I had to guess, I would say that the NLP modules in the NLP practitioner consisted of 25% theory and 75% application.

![In the background are mountains in blue and it is written as a quote from Tony Robbins in the foreground: Knowlege is not power. Knowledge is only potential power. Action is power.](/content/images/2022/10/Knowledge-is-not-power.-Knowledge-is-only-potential-power.-Action-is-power..png)

Action is power. - Tony Robbins

### 👩‍🔧 The Top 3 Techniques To Practice NLP on Yourself

#### Technique Nr. 1: Reflect, reflect, reflect

One of the best ways to learn about yourself is to take some time each day for reflection. As you reflect on your day, **pay attention to your thoughts, emotions, and behaviors.** What were some of the positive things that happened? What could you have done differently? What did you learn about yourself?

Create a diary with a few of your favourite questions for yourself.

If you don't know what to write about, you can read the [3-minute journal](/nr-7-journal-for-1-hour/), where you will find a template with short and powerful questions. You don't have to take more than **3 minutes to answer them each day.**

![questions from the blogpost "Journal for 1 hour" which I always ask myself in the morning and evening](/content/images/2023/02/journal-morning-and-evening-nlp-questions.png)

Questions to ask yourself in the morning and evening

#### Technique Nr. 2: Action, Make, and Do

Once you have learned some NLP techniques, **integrate them into your everyday life.**  
  
For example, to improve your communication skills, practice mirroring and matching the posture and breathing of the person you are speaking with. People like people who are how they would like to be or who are like them. Elements of mirroring in NLP include the volume and tone of voice, touch, gestures, facial expression, keywords or phrases and much more.  
  
To overcome procrastination, set realistic goals and create action plans with specific deadlines. Get yourself into a peak state and go for it. 😎

![Mirroring. 2 Men imitate everything the other one does (not exactly how mirroring works)](https://media.tenor.com/ROfPsgvyNigAAAAC/mirror-duck-soup.gif)

How to Manage Your State

#### Technique Nr. 3: Be your own coach

A great way to practice NLP on yourself is to **act as your own coach.**  
  
Every day, ask yourself what you want to achieve and what steps you need to take to get there. As you progress towards your goals, regularly check in with yourself to see how you are doing and make necessary adjustments. You can also coach other people – friends, family members, and colleagues – using NLP techniques.  
  
This not only helps them achieve their objectives but also allows you to hone your own skills.

### 🧰 The Top 3 NLP Techniques (In my opinion)

As NLP gathered the best techniques, tools, and formats from client-centered therapy, Gestalt therapy, hypnotherapy, and cognitive science, it is difficult to choose the best three.

However, enclosed, I wrote the three most important skills you can have to change your own and your client's life.

#### NR #1: 😍 [State management](/discovering-my-peak-state/)

The first step to achieving any goal is getting yourself into the right mind. It will be challenging to achieve anything positive if you're feeling stressed, anxious, or angry. **Learning how to manage your state** Controlling your thoughts and emotions can be achieved through breathing exercises, a confident posture, meditation, or visualization.

The person living state management is Tony Robbins. He has [this article](https://www.tonyrobbins.com/stories/unleash-the-power/discover-your-peak-state/) describing how to get into a peak state.

Here you will find everything you need to know about state management, in a [short and compact summary](/creating-absolute-certainty-tony-robbins/) I wrote in the latest newsletter edition.

![A Triangle is shown with the forces that control your emotions. State is written in the middle of the triangle and the sides which influence your State are Psychology, Focus and Language.](/content/images/2023/10/state_triangle_tony_robbins_nlp.svg)

The State Triangle

**The Tony Robbins Results Coaching**

I even did a Tony Robbins coaching with a results coach personally trained by Tony Robbins. It was the most intense coaching session I have ever had.

In just 30 minutes, I knew where I was, where I wanted to go, and what I needed to do to get there. I [listed the transformative questions](/7-mind-bending-coaching-questions-a-tony-robbins-result-coach-asked-me/) in a blog post and made them publicly available.

#### 🦚 There are only 2 states:

1.  Beautiful state (high-energy, peak states)
2.  Suffering (low-energy states)

In the event "Unleash the Power Within," we had to begin to answer the following questions to uplift our emotional state:

1.  What will a beautiful state give you? Why will you live in a beautiful state in the future, regardless of what might come your way?
2.  Why MUST you free yourself from all suffering now? How would your life look like if you freed yourself from fear right now?

### NR #2: 🗯 Storytelling

Even though storytelling is a "normal" coaching practice, it is one of the most powerful tools we have for influencing others. When you **tell a compelling story, you can capture people's attention and imagination and inspire them to take action.** I still don't know how my NLP Trainer and Coach does it, but somehow he tells such compelling stories that I cannot do anything other than listen.

After a long day at work on Friday evening, we normally have a 4-hour session with him. I did not know even to digress once. **I think he could tell about Martians eating an egg in an underwater submarine, and I would still be fully concentrated on the matter.** If anyone knows how he does it, please write me.

> “Stories constitute the single most powerful weapon in a leader’s arsenal.” - [Dr. Howard Gardner](https://www.gse.harvard.edu/faculty/howard-gardner), professor Harvard University

If you want to learn more about storytelling, "Storyworthy", by Matthew Dicks is a great book I recently listened to on Audible. I would 100% recommend this book if you are:

*   interested in telling better stories
*   like listening to engaging stories
*   want to know how to keep listeners glued to your lips

### NR #3:❓Questions

Another key tool in NLP is asking questions. Definitely check out the 7 mind-bending questions from the Tony Robbins Result Coaching.  
  
Asking the right questions – both of yourself and others – can help you clarify what you want and find creative solutions to obstacles in your way. When trying to achieve something, constantly asking yourself "why" can help you identify your deepest motivation and keep moving forward even when things get tough.

### 💭 5 Quick NLP Interventions to Eliminate Negative Behavioral and Thought Patterns

Maybe you have a belief system that is limiting you. That's perfect for today!

(💖 If you don't have any problems, this method is unfortunately not for you.)

I want to name some examples of belief systems I have heard people share over the years.

*   "I am too fat."
*   "I'm a failure."
*   "I just can't do it."
*   **"I'm too stupid for this."**

Let's take that last sentence for the exercise.

Which negative thoughts about yourself have lately crossed your mind?

The next time a negative belief comes up, **ask yourself the following 5 questions.** (Those who want to make real progress will probably photograph or copy the questions so they can refer to them when the thought arises.)

#### **😎 Let's begin. Start here.**

#### 🦥 Create some emotional distance

**"What would (your role model/person who has dealt with a similar issue) do now?"** Which posture would she/he have? What would your role model focus on? (The problem? or how to somehow find a way?)

#### 🍰 A part of me ...

**One side** of me experiences itself as... (stupid).

**A part** of me experiences itself as ... (stupid) Is there another part, which has a slightly different opinion, maybe?

#### 🖇 Presumption

I am **currently** **still** too stupid.

(Because we say the words "currently still", there is the presumption that it can and will change in the future).

#### 🏆 Positive intention

Ask yourself:

**"How does this thought want to support me?**

**If it does not support me, how could it?**

**What is the positive intention behind it? "**

"I am so stupid." Maybe the answer is, "I still have some things to learn."

#### 🔜 Ask about the consequences

How would you feel if you still had the **same feeling in a few weeks, months, or even years?** What **opportunities will you have missed** in life?

#### 🔥 [Bonus] + 3 Popular NLP Techniques

[****Anchoring****](/the-moment-of-excellence-experience-powerful-positive-and-passionate-feelings-at-the-push-of-a-button/),

This technique creates a positive association (or "anchor") with a certain place, object, or sound. 

Whenever you need a boost of confidence or motivation, you can refer to your anchor to help get yourself into a positive state. For example, you might listen to an uplifting song before an important meeting, touch a certain spot on your wrist whenever you need a reminder to stay calm or keep a picture of your goal in your wallet.

Now, you can look at it whenever you need inspiration.

****Reframing****

This technique involves changing the way you think about an experience or situation. 

For example, if you're anxious about an upcoming presentation, reframe it by telling yourself it's an opportunity to showcase your expertise and knowledge. Or, if you make a mistake at work, reframe it by telling yourself it's a learning opportunity that will help you do better next time.

Reframing can help change negative thinking patterns and give you a more positive outlook.

****Visualization****

This technique involves using your imagination to visualize yourself achieving your goals. 

For example, if you're trying to lose weight, visualize yourself eating healthy foods and exercising regularly. Or, if you're trying to get promoted at work, visualize yourself putting in extra effort and impressing your boss with your results. 

Visualization can help increase motivation and confidence levels, making it more likely that you'll achieve your goals.

> “Becoming the type of person you want to become — someone who lives by a stronger standard, someone who believes in themselves, someone who can be counted on by the people that matter to them — is about the daily process you follow and not the ultimate product you achieve.”

## An NLP Roadmap: Where to start and where to go

### #1. 👶 [NLP Practitioner Training](/first-practitioner-getting-started-first-steps-for-dummies/)

In the Practitioner, one deal with the basic building blocks of NLP.

When we look at the Dylts Pyramid, the focus is on the bottom 3 layers: **Environment, Skills, and Behavior**.

You learn **methods and techniques and** build a good **foundation** that you can use throughout your career of personal development.

[The Practitioner](https://www.landsiedel.com/ch/nlp-ausbildung/online-practitioner-ausbildung.html?ref=neurohackingly.com) was my **absolute favorite training.**

### 😱 Presuppositions NLP

With NLP, I can manipulate people and make them dance like puppets.

With the help of NLP, people do what they want.

With similar beliefs, I signed up for the NLP Practitioner at Landsiedel.

After the NLP Practitioner ...

... and with a completely different attitude.

### 🌟 My 10 personal highlights of attending the first NLP Practitioner Training

1.  You learn how to get control over your own emotions
2.  Each participant gets to fill out an **implementation journal** reflecting on the following (actually 3 trivial questions, but they make so much difference)
3.  What successes have you had so far?
4.  What were your main insights in this module?
5.  What will you implement, or what will change in your life as a result of this module?
6.  **Timeline work**

> "It is never too late to have had a happy childhood." - Milton Erickson

7\. The power of **pattern interruption.** If you want to dissolve problems, you don't have to do anything but constantly interrupt the negative pattern.

8\. We have learned ingenious **language patterns** that I often use daily. They help to get your message across and influence the other person's thinking and behavior.

9\. Without **submodalities,** I probably would not have managed to [run](/podcast/how-to-run-a-marathon-without-any-training-2/) a [marathon](/podcast/how-to-run-a-marathon-without-any-training-2/). They've helped me tone down strong emotions a few times.

**10\. Reframing**: I love reframing. A few questions you can ask yourself to get a **different perspective on your problem:**

*   What's great about it?
*   What do you learn from this?
*   What is not yet perfect in the current situation?
*   How can you enjoy the process?

Below is the result of a peer group evening on **"the power of words."** Language is one of 3 elements of how you can influence your state consciously. (according to Tony Robbins) More in [this video.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKl_sfGG4WI&t=2s&ref=neurohackingly.com)

#### If you speak German and are still considering where to do your NLP Practitioner training, unfold me.

🏆 6 Reasons why I chose to do the first NLP Practitioner at Landsiedel (biggest NLP provider in the german speaking community)

1.  High value is placed on ****putting**** learned models and techniques into practice (successes are documented with the help of an implementation journal).
2.  ****Focus on personal issues**** in peer groups, breakout sessions (coached each other), and live demos
3.  The CEO ****Stephan Landsiedel**** has held the ****NLP trainer course**** himself: What inspired me is 1. his story of how he created himself and the brand Landsiedel. 2. how simple and understandable he can explain NLP and psychology.
4.  The 7 modules are spread over 7 weekends (about every month); they are intensive, and you can ****deepen your knowledge in**** between in the weekly ****peer groups.****
5.  Has constantly ****co-trainers**** with whom you can ask questions about content but also personal topics
6.  If you are looking for an education to relax, to be sprinkled, and to have no problems (that you want to work on), then Landsiedel is not the right place for you.

🤸♂️ Why you'll have more energy after a 20h coaching weekend than before it: Our NLP Practitioner Trainer

Do you know energy zombies? By that, I mean people who suck the energy out of your body.

After you have talked to them, you feel an inner emptiness; you are tired and limp. The trainer, [Marian Zefferer](https://marianzefferer.at/?ref=neurohackingly.com), who I had in the Practitioner and Master and now have again in the Coach, is the exact opposite. After his NLP weekends, some of which last over 20 hours, you have ****more energy, NLP knowledge, and the motivation to try out what you have learned in everyday life.****

I also picked up tremendous knowledge in technology and how to ****properly design online training.****

The ****great atmosphere**** among the participants and the ****family atmosphere**** might make you leave your comfort zone. Read more here.

#2. 🧒 [NLP Master Training](/online-master-landsiedel-7-modules-overview/)

**The Master consists of a total of 7 modules**:

**1\. Values** \- is much about self-awareness. You get to know your values better with intensive exercise.

**2\. Beliefs** \- using different formats to shake the belief pole, again and again, to pull it out of the ground finally.

**3\. Hypnosis** \- Storytelling, Metaphors, Utilization Principle, Language Patterns ... What more could you want? Absolute favorite module!

**4\. Metaprograms - We have** specific thought patterns that determine how we perceive information (structured - optional, rational - emotional, motivated toward something, motivated away from something).

**5\. Modeling** \- I want to learn a skill. I choose a model that can do the skill. I look at the model's strategy. I apply it tailored to me.

**6\. Sleight of Mouth** (+Provocative Coaching) - Reframing beliefs, that's Sleight of Mouth.

**7\. Hypnosystemic approach -** You learn how a problem becomes a problem. Goes from the problem to the solution.

## 👁‍🗨 Vision Board 2023

One way to **visualize your goals** is with the help of a vision board.

#### Like [the Wheel of Life](https://core.tonyrobbins.com/wheel-of-life-4/), I divided my life into different areas:

🗻 Personal development

💘 Friendship/family

🏟 Career

😜 Free fun time

🥦 Health

💸 Finance

> The first step in closing the gap, however, is to figure out where you already are. A map can only guide you to where you want to go if you know your precise starting point.

![a pyramid: bottom to top: physical body, emotions & meaning, relationships, time, work/career/mission, finances, celebrate & contribute](/content/images/2023/02/the-wheel-of-life-from-tony-robbins-for-self-improvement.png)

The Pyramid of Mastery by Tony Robbins

#### Example: How to get the most out of your 2023 Vision Board

Focus on the 2 most important areas you want to improve this year.

**Questions you can ask yourself:**

*   Where am I right now? Where do I want to go?
*   What would a successful person do? What would a healthy person do?

**Let's say that your main focus is financing.**

*   Okay, what mentors can help you?
*   What exactly will you do, and how can you measure it?

Write it down.

#### 🎯 Vision Board Continuation

Then, I searched the internet for photos that resonated with me. Whenever I leave my room, I am reminded of my goals.

I also put up some **reminders of past successes** to remind me of what I have already accomplished.

If you want to do your Vision Board digitally, [Canva](https://www.canva.com/create/vision-boards/) is a great tool. I honestly just did it with Microsoft Word.

## 🌈 Resilience: The Simplest Way To Overcome And Grow Stronger Out Of A Current Crisis

_Not everything always goes according to plan._ I have summarized the best resilience strategies from the course developed by Professor Dr. Jutta Heller, an expert in the field of resilience.

_Everyone experiences a crisis at some point in their life._

I did the worst thing I could do. I locked myself up in my room and **sank into self-pity.**

But what changed for me was the realization that **we all have a choice.** And as soon as that clicked, I started to understand that overcoming this crisis wasn't that hard—I just had to get help.

#### Here's what I did

I took an online resilience course from [Prof. Dr. Jutta Heller](https://juttaheller.de/?ref=neurohackingly.com).

What is resilience? It is the **ability to get out of a crisis mentally and physically stronger** than before.

### These are seven practical tips on how to handle a current crisis

1.  👸 Take time for yourself. Look for a protected place in nature, at home, or on a short vacation.
2.  ⚖ Check whether it is **good to be alone** or prefer to be **with someone familiar.** Being together without talking will help you to heal.
3.  📆 Set up a **daily schedule** and stick to it (getting up, meal times, active times, relaxation phases, bedtime).
4.  **✍ Bring your thoughts to paper** - by talking or writing. Find an understanding listener who can bear your complaints and support you.
5.  👍 Notice **what has remained intact in the current crisis.** Write down these aspects in your different areas of life (job, family, friends, hobbies, etc.).
6.  **⛷ Moderate physical activity** is helpful, as the clarification process can slowly end.
7.  **🎁 Be understanding and patient with yourself.** Such a process takes time.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, practicing NLP on yourself can be a highly effective way to change your life. By using powerful tools and strategies, you can **achieve your goals and transform yourself into the person you want to be.** If you're committed to self-development, learning NLP is a **great way to take your journey to the next level.**

#### Explained in 4 bullet points:

• Neuro-linguistic programming (NLP) is an approach to communication and self-development used to achieve desired goals, break negative thinking, and discover true values. It has been gaining massive popularity due to its effectiveness in curing lifelong phobias in a short amount of time.

• NLP is best learned through an NLP Trainer or coach, workshops, and seminars.

• Benefits of practicing NLP include being able to use positive language, gaining inner freedom, having greater influence on yourself and others, freeing yourself from blockages and destructive behaviors.
