🧐

Can you see it? Are you someone who takes a step back and discovers something special?

**Sometimes** I ask myself if **the**re is a meaning in life.

Many people don’t think about these sorts of **things**.

Do you?

Recently I read the book [Ikigai, by Héctor García And Francesc Miralles](https://amzn.to/3sRhsdU) (amazon link).

Ikigai translates to: what do **we** get up for in the morning?

Answer these **really** short, four questions if you **want** to get to know the meaning of life

1.  What do you love?
2.  What **are** you good at?
3.  What can you be paid for?
4.  What does the world need from you?

To find your Ikigai, ask yourself: What do your four answers have in common? There is no wrong or **right.** Your mean**in**g of life. You now have it right in **front** of you.

Scientists found 4 keys a life has to consist **of** if you want to get old and in great shape.

The following things help **us:**

*   Diet,
*   Exercise,
*   Finding a purpose in life (an Ikigai),
*   Finally, **we** should have a broad circle of friends and good family relations.

The happiest people are the ones who spend more time than others in a state of flow.

**Just** consider these 3 points if you want to achieve the state of flow

*   Find a task that is difficult, but not too difficult
*   **Don’t** focus on what you can't do. Have a concrete and clear objective
*   **See**k to single-task

And remember **them** words:

> “Everything can be taken from a man but one thing: the last of the human freedoms—to choose one’s attitude in any given set of circumstances, to choose one’s own way.” - Victor Frankl

Studying

Meta-learning Learning about learning is a topic I’ve been thinking, researching, and writing about a lot over the last few years. Over time, I have learned how much easier life can be, if you see studying as something you can enjoy. Therefore, it has become a kind of life task
