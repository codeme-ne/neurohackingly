👋 Hello Friend

This weekend, I had the privilege of co-training at an NLP (Neuro-Linguistic Programming) Practitioner course by Landsiedel.

After a 20-hour hypnosis module, I'd like to share my top takeaways on the subject of hypnosis with you. If you think of hypnosis as people suddenly clucking like chickens on stage, I’m afraid I’ll have to disappoint you. That’s not what you’ll learn today.

**In this week's issue ✉️**

*   How to use hypnosis in everyday life
*   Techniques to influence skeptics
*   Methods to break free from limiting beliefs
*   Strategies for effective self-hypnosis
*   Tips for maintaining a positive focus and mindset

## 🐞 I want to tell you a story: What do jumping fleas in a jar have to do with our way of thinking?

In a curious experiment, a scientist placed a group of lively fleas into a glass jar. Immediately, they began to leap out with impressive energy. Intrigued, the scientist returned the fleas to the jar and secured a glass lid over the top. The fleas continued to jump, repeatedly striking the glass lid and tumbling back down.

After a while, a fascinating change occurred.

The fleas, having learned from their painful encounters, began to jump just shy of the glass lid, avoiding the painful impact. This behavior continued consistently until, one day, the scientist removed the glass lid entirely. But a surprising thing happened – the fleas, though now free to leap to their heart's content, remained constrained by their previous experience.

They continued to jump only as high as the former barrier, even though the lid was no longer there.

The fleas had been conditioned to believe they could not escape, their potential limited by an invisible barrier of their own making.

✍️ What lessons can you draw from this story?

## 😵‍💫 The top insights I have learned about hypnosis and how you can practically integrate them into your everyday life

### #1. 🎬 Be mindful of the content you consume.

It's not unlikely that the story from the movie will influence a part of your life. We tend to adopt the attitudes of the protagonists. If the protagonist solves his problems through violence, this could influence your problem-solving method in the future.

### **#2.** 🤔 **How do you get skeptics to do what you want?**

Use negations! Say, for example, “You probably shouldn't empty the dishwasher today.” Give it a try ;)

### **#3. 👥 My Friend John Technique from Milton Erickson**

Do you know the situation?

A friend tells you about a problem, and you tell them the answer straight to their face. Yet, they keep making the same mistake over and over. What can you do? Try Milton Erickson's “My Friend John Technique.”:

Simply say, _“My friend John (or insert a trusted person) had the same problem. He always did this: (insert solution).”_

### #4. 🗣️ Use vague language to induce change in your partner**.**

It's much more likely that the other person will take action if you use vague language. With vague statements, there's less resistance: instead of saying, _“You need to be more confident,” say, “One can be confident.”_

### #5. 🚭 **Want to get rid of a bad habit?** Make it consciously excessive!

Eventually, it will become tiresome. Your brain will then associate the effort with the bad habit. It may sound unbelievable and extreme, but it works.

### #6. 😵‍💫 Self-Hypnosis with Betty Erickson's Method

I don't believe in affirmations. Repeating "I am happy, I am happy, I am happy" a thousand times doesn't help much.

This weekend, I experienced the best self-hypnosis I've ever done. It doesn't take longer than 15 minutes and is very easy to replicate.

#### This is the process of the most effective self-hypnosis exercise I know

#### STEP 1:

1.  **Name 5 things you see out loud:** _"I see a closet. I see a carpet," etc._
2.  **Name 5 things you hear out loud:** _"I hear cars passing by. I hear my computer humming," etc._
3.  **Name 5 things you feel out loud:** _"I feel warmth in my legs. I feel the wind blowing over my left arm," etc._

Then do the same again, only with 4 sentences, then with 3, 2 and 1. Like this:

*   4x see, 4x hear, 4x feel
*   3x see, 3x hear, 3x feel
*   2x see, 2x hear, 2x feel
*   1x see, 1x hear, 1x feel

For perfectionists: It doesn't matter if you can't remember whether you've already said 2 or 3 things you see.

#### STEP 2:

Now do the same with your eyes closed and imagine you are in your chosen place. If, for example, you want to win a soccer game, imagine you are at the soccer field. If you are going to take an important exam, imagine you are in the lecture hall.

Do the same as in STEP 1, quietly in your head. Imagine you are at the chosen place:

*   **Name 5 things you see quietly.**
*   **Name 5 things you hear quietly.**
*   **Name 5 things you feel quietly.**

Then do the same again, only with 4 sentences, then with 3, 2 and 1. Like this:

*   4x see, 4x hear, 4x feel
*   3x see, 3x hear, 3x feel
*   2x see, 2x hear, 2x feel
*   1x see, 1x hear, 1x feel

#### STEP 3: Self-Suggestion

*   **Visual:** See yourself achieving what you want.
*   **Auditory:** "I am a doer."
*   **Kinesthetic:** Feel how good it feels when you do what you set out to do.

### #7. 🎯 **Focus of attention:** What you do NOT want to focus on, you WILL focus on!

### #8. ❓ The Power of Your Questions: Shaping Your Reality

Our unconscious mind is constantly at work, processing the questions we ask ourselves. But are we asking the right questions?

Negative questions often lead to negative answers, which, while they may be truthful, can warp our perception of reality. For example, asking "Why does this always happen to me?" only reinforces negative beliefs and keeps you stuck.

This week, take a moment to be mindful of the questions you ask yourself. When you catch a negative question, reframe it into something positive. This simple shift can change your perspective, bringing you to a balanced state where you can make the best decisions and achieve productive outcomes.

By consciously choosing positive questions, you can transform your mindset and your life.

#### Focus Questions:

## Top 8 Takeaways Summary

*   Mindful Content Consumption: The media you consume can shape your thoughts and behaviors. Choose wisely to avoid adopting negative patterns.
*   Influencing Skeptics: Use reverse psychology to motivate skeptics. For example, "You probably shouldn't empty the dishwasher today" can prompt them to act.
*   The Friend Technique: When advice isn't working, share a relatable story using the "My Friend John Technique" to subtly suggest solutions.
*   Vague Language for Change: Encourage action with less resistance by using vague language. Instead of "You need to be more confident," say "One can be confident."
*   Breaking Bad Habits: Exaggerate the bad habit until it becomes tiresome. Your brain will start associating it with effort, helping you break free.
*   Self-Hypnosis Method: Use Betty Erickson's method. Describe what you see, hear, and feel, reducing the number each round. Then repeat with your eyes closed, imagining your success.
*   Focus of Attention: What you try not to focus on often becomes your main focus. Be mindful of where your attention goes.
*   Power of Questions: Your unconscious mind answers the questions you ask. Shift negative questions to positive ones to change your perspective and outcomes.

Have a wonderful week!
