👋 Hello Friend

That is the first part of the two-part series on the "Scientifically Based Anti-Aging Workout by Bryan Johnson for People Without 800 Million in the Bank."

After this two-part newsletter series, you will have a detailed weekly plan for being the healthiest version of yourself.

### In the newsletter series, we will cover the following topics

*   Studies on Exercise and Longevity
*   Measurements: Strenght, stretching & VO2 max
*   Tech Gadgets
*   Endurance training
*   A detailed workout routine for longevity (in next week's newsletter)

# Studies on Exercise and Longevity

Many studies show the importance of exercise for longevity. I will review three of these. 

1.  Regular leisure activities with moderate to high intensity (such as brisk walking, jogging, swimming) for at least 150 minutes per week have significant longevity benefits. ([https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1001335](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1001335))
2.  People who exceed the recommended physical activity levels show the greatest benefits in terms of life expectancy. ([https://doi.org/10.1136/bjsports-2021-105061](https://doi.org/10.1136/bjsports-2021-105061))
3.  A combination of endurance and strength training yields the best results for longevity. ([https://doi.org/10.1093/ije/dyy026)](https://doi.org/10.1093/ije/dyy026\))

# Measurements

It is important to take measurements to see where we are and where we want to go.

The measurements taken are based on the [ACSM standards](https://www.acsm.org/education-resources/trending-topics-resources/physical-activity-guidelines), which provide scientifically based guidelines on exercise testing and prescriptions for certification candidates, professionals, and students.

### To see results I would recommend doing the measurements every three months 

**#1. Bench press** single rep max (180 lbs – 08/29/2024)

**#2. VO2 max:** Increasing your VO2 max is important for longevity because it significantly impacts your cardiovascular health and overall physical fitness. (47 ml/min/kg – 08/29/2024)

VO2 max measures the maximum amount of oxygen your body can utilize during intense exercise, reflecting the efficiency of your cardiovascular and respiratory systems.

#### There are different methods on how to measure your Vo2 max. I have selected 3, from most expensive & accurate to cheapest & least accurate

1.  The most accurate way to measure VO2 max is in a ****lab under controlled conditions.****
2.  The second method is using a ****smartwatch or Oura ring**** [****(get a 40€ discount)****](https://ouraring.com/raf/829d05a58c?utm_medium=iac_raf)****.**** Personally, I know that the Oura Ring Generation 3 and the Garmin Smartwatch Venu2 can both measure VO2 max. They are pretty accurate because I have measured my Vo2 max with both and they did show the same result.
3.  The third method is ****the Cooper test****. For this, you only need a stopwatch.  
    Run as far as possible on a flat course or track within 12 minutes. Enter the distance covered in meters into the following formula: VO2 max: (distance (meters) - 504.9) / 44.73.  
    This is the least accurate way to calculate your Vo2 Max.

📄 More on the topic: [How VO2 max correlates with longevity, from Peter Attia](https://peterattiamd.com/how-does-vo2-max-correlate-with-longevity/)

**#3. Leg press**, single rep max. (408 lbs – 08/29/2024)

**#4. Push-ups**, continuous. (12 – 08/29/2024)

The term _continuous_ means that instead of holding the position for several seconds at the top, you should smoothly transition from the up phase to the down phase and back again without stopping.

**#5. Stretching test** (tbd)

The YMCA sit and reach. ([Instruction Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHyNDFo6ZHg)) This is a common measurement of flexibility in the lower back and hamstrings. This test is important because tightness in these areas is closely related to lower back pain and forward pelvic tilt.

Tightness in these areas can also contribute to potential injury during periods of increased activity.

Before testing you can adequately stretch as well as perform moderate aerobic exercise.

#### 6 steps on how to do the YMCA sit and reach test

1.  Mark a baseline on the floor.
2.  A ruler is placed perpendicularly to the baseline which crosses the baseline at 38 cm.
3.  Sit with the heels on the baseline with feet 30 cm apart.
4.  With the legs straight, slowly bend forward to reach the furthest point of the ruler.
5.  Hold for 2 seconds and record the distance.
6.  Perform three trials with the best score recorded.

**#6.** The sixth and final measurement exercise is measuring the **Grip strength of the dominant hand.** (tbd)

A study published by the European Journal of Ageing published that Hand grip strength is an important measure of overall physical ability and can predict how likely someone is to get sick or die. ([https://www.jospt.org/doi/full/10.2519/jospt.2018.7851](https://www.jospt.org/doi/full/10.2519/jospt.2018.7851))

# Endurance Training

For endurance training, it is useful to get a smartwatch or even the Polar H10 [Heart Rate Monitor](https://www.amazon.de/Polar-Herzfrequenz-Sensor-Bluetooth-Wasserdichter-Brustgurt/dp/B07PM54P4N/ref=sr_1_1_sspa?dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.RFGcC_963rU3WARKIRK3pbHDYG6W-cEBfZiA7uw-W72Kz3A47njmt-6XgE_8FBJbhaP9KDV3zYrGpcdoQU1brcI7R-9mC6k2vu6NY67qlH4NBPkXYEjQNBiHhqb2ZeNaUOTQv1quG4xLvQiJ5P2QuEf4XuEosFjcITnFZHET4J_GJGcFqWdII-Pgf-NDYPEMZPzvKiWz3iQEaXpIaz8O2vCUy_KnFPz0pSFoLLNYXVk.NP1NzMznY4kbk1B78cVnTRJDObpMwrAVhB6hokU5r0Q&dib_tag=se&keywords=h10%2Bpolar&qid=1719839603&sr=8-1-spons&sp_csd=d2lkZ2V0TmFtZT1zcF9hdGY&th=1) (€60-75).

We will now discuss the beats per minute of your heart, the different zones and the time in each zone you should reach per week.

*   Zone 1: 88-105 bpm,  ~1 hour per week
*   Zone 2-4: 106-159 bpm, ~4 hr 30 min
*   Zone 5: 159+ bpm, ~90 minutes

Don't have the ability to view how many minutes a week you spend in each zone? Try the [iOS app called Zones](https://apps.apple.com/de/app/zones-for-training/id1139688415) or [wahoo fitness app for Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.wahoofitness.fitness&hl=de).

To effectively train across different heart rate zones, follow this plan to hit the desired heart rate zones and durations. This will help improve your cardiovascular fitness, increase VO2 max, and enhance overall endurance.
