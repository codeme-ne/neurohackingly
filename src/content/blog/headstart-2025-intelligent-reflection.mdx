### ❇️ My Favorite Core Concept from Headstart 2025: Neurological Levels.

![](/content/images/2025/01/Neurological-Levels.png)

### How you can use the [Dilts Pyramid](https://www.landsiedel-seminare.de/en/nlp-library/neurological-levels.php) for Change

Imagine you want to change something in your life — for example, doing more exercise. You can use Dilts Pyramid to go through this change.

Let's go through the Neurological Levels by Dilts with the example of exercising more.

#### 🟢 Environment

**Problem:** You’re too tired after work to drive to the gym.

**Solution:** Set up an exercise corner at home.

#### 🟣 Behavior

**Problem:** You sit in front of the computer instead of exercising.

**Solution:** Introduce a new habit, like putting on your gym shoes right after work.

#### 🔵 Capabilities

**Problem:** You lack knowledge about effective exercises.

**Solution:** Book an appointment with a personal trainer to learn effective exercises.

#### 🟠 Beliefs & Values

**Problem:** The belief: “Exercise is not for me.”

**Solution:** Loosen this belief and replace it with one that serves you.

#### 🟡 Identity

**Solution:** Focus on becoming rather than achieving. Not “I want to do X,” but “I am becoming a runner. I am a runner.”

#### ⭐ Belonging - (with the Dilts Pyramid, **a framework grounded in NLP)**

**Solution:** Join a running community to build a vision.

Important: If you change a higher level, the lower levels shift automatically. For example, if your Identity is “I am an active person,” you’ll act like one and shape your environment accordingly.

These levels help you:

*   Better understand problems
*   Recognize where change is most effective
*   Find sustainable solutions instead of superficial ones

Use them as a diagnostic tool. If something doesn’t work out, check the different levels to locate the sticking point.

The reflection questions from Headstart 2025 are built on the neurological levels. This makes the process so powerful.

### 💘 Love Letter

After reflecting, we wrote a letter to our past selves from one year ago.

We took our insights and wrapped them in that letter.

* * *

### ❓ My favorite question from the reflection part:

If you had to name the last year with a single word... what would it be?

* * *

## 🚀 Upcoming in next week's issue:

We’ll talk about **ecological goals** and **artful implementation**.

Artful implementation is my favorite part of all of Headstart.

Why? Because we take our goals and create an action plan for every month of the upcoming year. Don’t miss it!

Have a productive week,

Lukas
