Hello friend,

After taking some weeks off, I'm excited to share what's been happening in my world.

# 1\. Vibe-Coding

My Bachelor's thesis is nearly complete! I've [vibe-coded](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vibe_Coding) an accountability app with [cursor.com](http://cursor.com). I love that you can build your own software faster than ever, from landing pages to a complete podcast marketing tool, like [Nat Eliason](https://www.buildyourownapps.com/) did.

# 2\. AI-Tool for Research

A game-changer in my academic work has been [https://app.otio.ai/](https://app.otio.ai/). This tool features documents on one side and an AI chat interface on the other, supporting multiple models including GPT-4.1 and Claude. My setup for completing academic assignments consists of Otio on one screen, Google Docs on the other, using [perplexity.ai](http://perplexity.ai) on certain occasions.

# 3\. AI-Productivity Course

I'm launching a 3-week [AI Productivity Course](https://www.produktiv.me/ki/) focused on enhancing efficiency through artificial intelligence. It's already fully booked.

# 4\. Speaker at Landsiedel

I'm also honored to be speaking at [Landsiedel NLP-Kongress 2025](https://www.landsiedel-seminare.de/nlp/nlp-kongress/nlp-kongress-zeilitzheim.html) about AI applications in coaching, following the renowned NLP expert on modeling, Ralf Stumpf.

# 5\. 12-week productivity course

My 12-week productivity course came to an end last week. I wrote [a whole blog post](https://www.produktiv.me/pw-1/) on my German website.

I want to make more consistent updates in the future, focusing on sharing just 3 weekly highlights that might be valuable to you.

Until next Sunday,

Lukas
