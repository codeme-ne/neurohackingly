Usually, my Notion Setup for Spaced Repetition looks like this. I put the questions in Notion. Depending on how well I can answer them, I mark the topic/question - as red/orange/yellow/green. I also add the date to the question.

The next time I go through the questions I first go through the ones which are marked red. Then repeat it over time, until I can then mark the question green.

I here have the main chapters 1 and 2. Then the subchapters 1\_1, 1\_2 etc.

1\_3\_1 and 1\_3\_2 are the questions then. Beneath the toggles, the answers are hidden.
