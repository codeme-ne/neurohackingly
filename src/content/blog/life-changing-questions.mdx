👋🏼Hello friend,

I hope you had a wonderful week. If unexpectedly, a challenge has come into your life, this is just the right Newsletter for you. (if not, you can save it for the future 🙂) **I have carefully selected 17 questions for you that will greatly loosen up a problem and maybe even solve it.**

Last summer I found myself in a situation that caused me many sleepless nights. I just didn't know what to do. I was spinning in circles.

When I already thought that I had tried EVERYTHING, my Neurolinguistic Programming (NLP) Trainer approached me. He sent me a document with the promise:

> After answering these questions, your problem will no longer be a problem.

Sure, **it's not a magic pill** that solves all your worries overnight, but I had many "aha moments" during this process. It brought me a lot further toward the solution and now I can only smile about the thoughts I had past summer.

Be sure to take your time and wait at least 30 seconds if the answer to the question doesn't arise. You can read the question out loud over and over again. If you wrote everything down and have spent 30 seconds on the question, move to the next one. **Don’t try to eagerly find an answer. Just let your thoughts flow and capture what you think on paper.**

#### (click me!) Exercise: 17 Powerful Questions 

1.  What is the core of the problem?
2.  What are 3 positive things about this problem?
3.  What will happen, when I have solved this problem?
4.  When does it seem least like a problem?
5.  (By) when does the problem need to be solved?
6.  Who would benefit most from solving this problem?
7.  Who could solve this problem the fastest?
8.  How could I get a fresh, new perspective on this problem?
9.  How will I know this problem is solved?
10.  Where (in what area/context) is the problem, not a problem?
11.  Where have I not yet looked for answers/solutions?
12.  What kind of person would I be if I solved this problem with ease?
13.  Why is solving this problem important?
14.  Why is this problem still here?
15.  What would happen if I knew that the problem would be solved tomorrow? How would it change what I am doing today?
16.  What if this problem turned out to be the best thing that has ever happened to me?
17.  What if this problem is entirely solved by the end of the day? What would I then focus on tomorrow?

Have a great week!

xx Lukas
