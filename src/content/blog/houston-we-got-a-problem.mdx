👋 Hello friend,

## 💯 It will be an even better week now

🛫 Human error is to responsible for more than 75% of plane crashes. Therefore, in around **25% of cases** (including a very small number of other causes), the **system is to blame.**

I don't have statistics on the number of newsletters that never reach their intended destination, but yesterday it was definitely (!!!) a technical issue. 😉 If I know something, it is how to push buttons.

In order to give you a nice start into the week, it was intended to arrive (as always) to your evening program. So, **I apologize if your Monday started off a little rocky.** The week officially begins in 3 ... 2 ... 1 ... 🚀

## 🌊 The hardest part is to even reach the flow

After a long time, I had the honor of **getting to coach again.** I thought to myself, it's like riding a bike - been there, done that. 🚴‍♂️

Yeah, well, wrong. 👎

It reminded me a bit of this graph.

I have to endure an uncomfortable ride up the mountain in the beginning. **After the struggle - release will come.** But when? ⏲

I just knew that I will not quit. Otherwise the **whole damn mountain will await me again.**

## 🙇‍♀️ There are two ways: Divergent and convergent thinking

We have **different modes of thinking.**

**📊** Convergent = analytical working towards a solution  
🎨 Divergent = creative idea development

I believe to have heard that one should **switch as little as possible between these two modes.** And it makes total sense.

### Lets take for example, writing.

🎨 First you **collect ideas and inputs and write all of them down** using the divergent thinking mode.

📊❗ However, once you start **correcting typos** in between (thus switching to the convergent mode) you quickly get out of flow.

I think I have experienced the same with coaching this weekend. I was switching modes back and forth searching for something ---

> There’s nothing wrong with continuously working to improve yourself and your life as long as you’re not so fixated on the outcome.

Have a great rest of the week. 💌
