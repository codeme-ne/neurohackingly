Hello friend 👋🏼

In the last few days I have intensively started to write diary again. Whenever I travel in a public transport, such as by train or streetcar to work, I now write diary.

**📏 Why length matters**

I think it's amazing what happens when I just let my thoughts run free. At first, when I start with the first few sentences, they are still a bit muddled. However, most of the time, when I get over the 200 word mark, I get into the flow and **just when I think I should stop** (usually at a good 800 words, if I had to estimate) **things really take off.** This is where the real valuable ideas come in, like things I still need to do and completely forgot about or insights about a conversation I already had a few weeks ago.

**💭 Written words become thoughts**

What I also find really good is that after I have done such a brain dump, I usually continue thinking for half an hour or an hour. That means **I can really observe my thoughts as they flow more slowly.** This often allows me to coach myself and think about what the reason is that I am having these thoughts.

A diary is like a psychiatrist, only free of charge. - Luke Z.

**🍏 New School (Digital Diary)**

Personally, I like having a digital diary that I can access on my computer and cell phone. It syncs permanently, so I can pick up where I left off on the computer. Personally, I think [Day One](https://dayoneapp.com/) is a really great app, but unfortunately it is only available for **iOS users.** I tried all the diary apps and finally fell in love with [Penzu](https://penzu.com/). This is also available for **Windows and Android users.** The entries are 100% private and you can protect them with 128-bit encryption. (Pro even 256-bit) 🔐

**📕 Old School (pen and paper)**

Of course, there is also the "old school" variant, for which I unfortunately have too little patience. I'm a bit faster with a keyboard. Maybe you prefer pen and paper? I also sometimes write with pen and paper and would like to share with you my favorite notebook, [Leutturm 1917 Notebook](https://amzn.to/3LIfsNO) and favorite pen, the [Pilot VBall](https://amzn.to/3LIwHyt). I think the notebook has such a beautiful design and **replacing the normal solid lines with dots** has something unique. I also don't know of **any pen that glides smoother across the paper** than the Pilot VBall.

**🐌 Tips for the start**

Last but not least, **two tips** if you also want to enjoy getting many great insights from journal writing:

Even if you can't think of anything at the moment, **sooner or later you** will come across **topics that are important to you** or from which you can draw something. Sometimes I just start something else in the middle of a sentence.... I wonder if other people feel the same way or if it's just me who has such mixed thoughts. Anyway, I write it down because it keeps you in the flow and you usually disrupt the thought process by editing 😉.

In Julia Cameron's book [The Artist's Way](https://amzn.to/3LMzLcJ), the author writes that at the beginning of the day you should simply **write down all your thoughts on a total of three A4 pages.** This helps to get all the negative thoughts out of your head to give more space to positive thoughts.

I wish you a wonderful week and many insightful diary entries. 📖

All love,

xx Luke

P.S. Sorry for the late newsletter. 🙈

I was able to successfully complete my **NLP** (Neuro Linguistic Programming) **trainer** at [Landsiedel](https://www.landsiedel.com/ch/) this weekend. After little sleep and with a lack of energy, I unfortunately didn't manage to **finish** my **1000 push-ups in one day challenge.** I finally managed 500. But I am still very happy with it. If you like you can read more about my 31 Days Challenge [here](/31daychallenge/). (you are also welcome to join 😀)
