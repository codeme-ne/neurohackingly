**How often have you read about upgrading your time-management system by using the Pomodoro method?**

Probably more than 100 times. I've dealt with learning how to study for over 6 years., and these are my go-to time management hacks.

## 🔰 Try these 3 time management tips to stop procrastinating and start studying

### 🛁 #1. Use the little time in between activities to let your mind wander.

Unlike most productivity advice, which suggests using every minute productively, I use the time when I run just to run.

I look out the window while riding the train. [I let my mind wander.](/the-diffused-mode-how-to-solve-a-difficult-problem/) Working the whole day, the brain deserves a break sometimes.

When I then come back to do focused work, I feel refreshed.

I am much more relaxed, unlike when I try to fill every spare minute trying to do something productive.

### 🏳 #2. Stop with the To-Do List. Instead, write down one single to-do item and do it. Cross it out and write down the next to-do item.

In Ali Abdaals' podcast Deep Dive, the author of [4000 Weeks](https://amzn.to/3uWgHRS), Oliver Burkman, recommends this simple productivity hack.

There is no need for any additional fancy productivity apps.

### ✍ #3. Go back to paper and pencil. On the computer, open Microsoft Word.

There are certainly great tools to help you study; however, these frequently distract us from our actual tasks.

Some weeks ago, while I was writing my posts, I was always looking for the next AI writing tool to improve my writing. I procrastinated and failed to complete the task at hand: writing.

## ♻ Conclusion

1.  Use breaks to relax.
2.  Shorten your to-do list.
3.  Cut off the internet when studying.
