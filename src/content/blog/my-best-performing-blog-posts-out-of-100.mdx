👋 Hello friend,

With all the content, it is even hard for me to keep track of all my blog posts.

## According to Analytics, this are the TOP 2 Most Viewed Blog Posts out of 100 published  (+key takeaways)

#### 🌞 [This Is The Best Book I’ve Ever Read On Building A Morning Routine](/building-a-morning-routine/)

### Key Takeaway

**#1** **The Morning Routine** mentioned in [The Miracle Morning](https://amzn.to/3Baxap8) by Hal Elrod _consists of 6 daily practices: acronym Life S.A.V.E.R.S._

*   **S**tillness

#### 🎶 [The 8 best audio programs by Tony Robbins, including the #1 self development system ever "Ultimate Edge", +100 hours of audio content: These are my top 10 takeaways + 5 bonus insights](/audio-programs-self-improvement-tony-robbins/)

### Key Takeaway(s)

**#1 Excitement must lead to immediate action.**

The 72-hour rule states: If you don't take action within the next 72 hours, _the probability that you will ever take action is close to zero._

**#2 If you want to take the island, burn the boats.**

I applied this when running a marathon. I signed up but _didn't get the cancellation insurance to make sure I wouldn't cancel the race._

**#3 Use powerful words for getting boring things done.**

Like _outstanding, life-changing, transforming, out of this world, inspiring, gigantic_ _etc._

I hope you liked this weeks newsletter!

Have a great week!
