👋 Hello friend

## I am participating in Ali Abdaal's community Productivity Lab.

In the next 12 weeks, we will go through his Life Productivity System. This week, we focused on the area: FOCUS.

Ali made a hypothesis: **By tracking our focus sessions, we will be able to double our productivity.**

## I now track my focus time with Google Sheets.

I note:

*   📝 Task
*   ⏱️ Start and end times
*   ⌛ Duration (calculated)
*   📚 Topic
*   🤔 Reflection

The log tracks activities, start and stop times, total focus time, project names, and reflections. Entries are color-coded for better visual organization.](/content/images/2024/07/focus-log-in-google-sheets.jpg)

My focus log in Google Sheets

## After logging some sessions, analyze trends by asking chatGPT.

I asked ChatGPT about focuslog trends and patterns. It shared valuable insights:

*   Best focus times: 11am - 1pm and 3pm - 5pm.
*   Breaking admin work into 15-minute chunks.
*   Taking regular breaks.

## Hourly Breakdown: A productive hour looks like this:

![A visual representation of a productivity routine, divided into different time segments. The routine starts with a 5-minute "Align" session followed by a 5-minute "Organize" session, then a 50-minute "Focus" period, and concludes with a 5-minute "Recharge" session and a 5-minute "Reflect" session. The sections are color-coded with "Align" in gray, "Organize" in purple, "Focus" in gold, "Recharge" in green, and "Reflect" in blue.](/content/images/2024/07/focushour-align-organize-focus-reflect-recharge-with-time.jpg)

Structured focus session

**Total: 60 minutes**

1.  Five minutes: Organize
    *   Tidy up.
    *   Get a drink.
    *   Use the restroom.
2.  Fifty minutes: Focus
3.  Five minutes: Reflect & Rest
    *   Review work and plan for the next session.
    *   Stretch and walk.

This routine is a game-changer. 🚀

## Productivity Update

In the [last newsletter](/productivity-boost/), I offered to help with productivity issues.

I've received many questions. I'll respond to all within three days. You can still send in questions for a few more days. 🙂

Have a great week!

xx Lukas 🤗
