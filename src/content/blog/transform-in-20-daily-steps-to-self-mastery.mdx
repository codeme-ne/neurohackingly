👋 Hello friend

*   I spent over 20.000$ in coaching and personal development training in the last years.
*   I have received hundreds of valuable documents with the latest & established methods to start a transformation or to give the right push to get the rock rolling again.
*   I gained over 2000 hours of highly valuable experience coaching myself and others using NLP (Neuro-linguistic programming), mental training, and other powerful forms of coaching.

As we approach the end of another year, it's the perfect time to reflect, reassess, and reinvigorate our lives.

#### With this in mind, I'm excited to introduce our exclusive 20-day Self-Coaching Newsletter, **TransFORM in 20: Daily Steps to Self-Mastery** designed to give you a headstart entering 2024.

I have spent the last few weeks selecting only the most impactful exercises from over 15 coaching and training courses I have completed in the last 5 years. (so you don't have to 😉) This will catapult your learning into new dimensions.

💬 Gathering feedback from subscribers, one recently told me:

> "Something has changed in such a short time. It's amazing that so little can make such a big difference and last the whole day. How does this work?"

So, if you are a person who likes to act before the masses do, and wants to create something instead of just watching, then sign up now for the exclusive 20-day newsletter. It's worth it, I promise.

[Let's Do This!](https://transformativeselfmastery.substack.com?utm_source=navbar&utm_medium=web&r=34nn5z)

For you, my subscribers, it's completely free. (Just click on "no pledge")

#### 👀 Here's a glimpse of what you can expect:

*   **Day 1**: A Fun and Effective Beginning: Let Go of the Past and Effortlessly Forge New Paths.
*   **Day 2**: Learning from Professional Athletes: Unlocking Full Mental and Physical Potential Within Seconds with this mind-blowing mental exercise
*   ... and so on, until Day 20, we'll reflect on the journey and chart the path forward.

There's no charge for this journey; it's entirely free for my subscribers as a token of appreciation for your continued support. If you're ready to give yourself this gift of self-improvement, click the link below to confirm your subscription.
