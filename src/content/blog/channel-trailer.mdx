#### Transcript

Hello everyone and welcome to Neurohackingly. This is a weekly podcast where I talk about personal development. I will talk about how to optimize your lifestyle, become healthier, and how to really develop a stronger mindset. We will together explore how to get the most out of our mind, brain, and body through things like exercise, sleep supplementation, cold therapy, meditation, and so much more.

How cheeky it maybe sounds. But I'm on a mission. I'm on a mission to become the best version of myself, and my goal is to pull you along if you let me. If you really want to get out of your comfort zone and get the most out of your life, this podcast is definitely worth listening to. For me personal, I study business informatics and have more than 1000 hours of coaching experience with teams and also one on one coaching.

I'm a certified and a P trainer, mental and agile coach, and I'm working on personal development for over 10 years of my life. My podcast will be available on all major podcast platforms like Spotify, iTunes, and Google Podcasts. Links to that will be down in the video description or in the show notes.

I'd be glad if you can just leave me a short review on iTunes store and the way we can engage with comments on the podcast is usually on the you YouTube channel itself because you normally can't comment on past podcast listening platform. I hope you will enjoy that podcast and yeah, I'll see you around.

Bye-bye.
