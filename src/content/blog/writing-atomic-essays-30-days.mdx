30 days ago, I signed up for Dickie Bush & Nicolas Cole's cohort-based course, Ship 30 for 30.

In that time, I wrote & published 29 Atomic Essays, learned the fundamentals of Digital Writing, made friends, and started gaining clarity over what my niche might be. It has been a very rewarding (and challenging) journey, and I am more excited than ever to keep writing online.

Here are the 3 biggest things writing & publishing consistently every day for 30 days taught me:

## 🤲 1. Writing Is Sustainable. You Have The Feeling Of Contributing Something.

For me, there is **nothing worse than spending time doing something that doesn't generate any use** for me or at least one other person.

As a student, I encountered this feeling sometimes.

1.  Study.
2.  Write the test.
3.  Get a grade. Test goes into garbage. Most of the acquired knowledge, too. **It's ephemeral.**

Now, there are 30 short essays on the Internet, probably for a long time.

Something that maybe one day our own grandchildren will read.

## 🆘 2. I have no niche

I have a **scanner personality.** I'm interested in many different areas. Sure, I want to go into depth with certain subjects. However, I cannot work only on one subject.

Currently, it is psychology, but **who knows what direction it will take me tomorrow.**

## 💯 3. Create A Positive Change By Focusing On Higher Standards And Turning "Shoulds" Into "Musts."

This applies to everything, not just daily writing.

I remember two weeks ago, coming home tired and not in the mood to write a single word at 1 a.m. However, **the community, making it a top priority, and maintaining a writing streak** motivated me to continue publishing every day.

* * *

If you have been thinking about getting started writing online too, let me know. I'm happy to share more about the experience and what I learned.

**Definitely give it a try if one of the points applies:**

*   you want to have a strong peer group and stay accountable
*   produce compelling online content
*   learn simple frameworks for quick and easy publishing
*   figure out your niche
