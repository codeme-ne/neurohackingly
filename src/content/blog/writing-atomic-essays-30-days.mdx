30 days ago, I signed up for Dickie Bush & Nicolas Cole's cohort-based course, Ship 30 for 30.

In that time, I wrote & published 29 Atomic Essays, learned the fundamentals of Digital Writing, made friends, and started gaining clarity over what my niche might be. It has been a very rewarding (and challenging) journey, and I am more excited than ever to keep writing online.

Here are the 3 biggest things writing & publishing consistently every day for 30 days taught me:

## 🤲 1. Writing Is Sustainable. You Have The Feeling Of Contributing Something.

For me, there is **nothing worse than spending time doing something that doesn't generate any use** for me or at least one other person.

As a student, I encountered this feeling sometimes.

1.  Study.
2.  Write the test.
3.  Get a grade. Test goes into garbage. Most of the acquired knowledge, too. **It's ephemeral.**

Now, there are 30 short essays on the Internet, probably for a long time.

Something that maybe one day our own grandchildren will read.

## 🆘 2. I have no niche

I have a **scanner personality.** I'm interested in many different areas. Sure, I want to go into depth with certain subjects. However, I cannot work only on one subject.

Currently, it is psychology, but **who knows what direction it will take me tomorrow.**

## 💯 3. Create A Positive Change By Focusing On Higher Standards And Turning "Shoulds" Into "Musts."

This applies to everything, not just daily writing.

I remember two weeks ago, coming home tired and not in the mood to write a single word at 1 a.m. However, **the community, making it a top priority, and maintaining a writing streak** motivated me to continue publishing every day.

If you have been thinking about getting started writing online too, let me know. I'm happy to share more about the experience and what I learned.

**Definitely give it a try if one of the points applies:**

*   you want to have a strong peer group and stay accountable
*   produce compelling online content
*   learn simple frameworks for quick and easy publishing
*   figure out your niche

I completely understand, it's a big investment, financially as well as time-wise.

## 💌 Newsletter

If you decide to go for the free option, for now, I can wholeheartedly recommend the newsletter. They do Deep Dives breaking down **advanced writing techniques, content strategies, and money-making digital business frameworks.**

## Free Email Course

They also have a [free email course](https://shop.ship30for30.com/referral/next-cohort/MSijcsFBbvFMTN3V), which is a compressed version of the core frameworks and digital writing principles they've taught to over 4,000 writers in Ship 30 over the past 2 years.
