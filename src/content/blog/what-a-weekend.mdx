👋 Hello friend

Over the last 35 years, Tony Robbins has perfected his 4-day seminar _Unleash The Power Within._ I participated online.

<GifVideo alt="" webm="/images/what-a-weekend/the-power-within-spongebob.webm" mp4="/images/what-a-weekend/the-power-within-spongebob.mp4" poster="/images/what-a-weekend/the-power-within-spongebob.jpg" />

Before you now think: "Oh dear, now he's gone completely nuts." Well, perhaps you're right. 😅 Yet, the energy + learnings I got from this event is absolutely nuts, too.

## **2 Quotes, 1 insight and 1 short story**

> _Knowing is not enough; we must apply. Willing is not enough; we must do. – Johann Wolfgang von Goethe_

🧙‍♂️ I have stumbled across this quote several times lately. At the Tony Robbins event, the main focus was to **apply what you learnt**, too.

On Saturday, when I was standing in line at the supermarket, I remembered the following:

> _"Good timber does not grow with ease. The stronger the wind, the stronger the trees."_

💪 Every bodybuilder knows: The **last few repetitions** (~10% of the total repetitions done) **bring 90% of muscle growth.**

Applying this to life, it's easy to be friendly to people who are friendly to you. The real challenge is to be friendly to people who are unfriendly. That's when real emotional growth happens.

Scanning the items I bought, the cashier didn't even look at me.

I said hello. No answer. Just when I was about to leave, I got all my courage together and asked: Could I see your teeth?

😑 Unfortunately, I don't think she understood that I wanted her to smile.

Well, at least I brought her out of state for a short moment. I am definitely looking forward to next time meeting her. Hope she is too. 🙂

Have a great week!

xx Lukas

# ✍🏻 Quote of the week:

> "Action is what unites every great success. Action is what produces results. Knowledge is only potential power until it comes into the hands of someone who knows how to get himself to take effective action. In fact, the literal definition of the word “power” is “the ability to act.”

From [Unlimited Power](https://amzn.to/3WEp7tO) by Tony Robbins.
