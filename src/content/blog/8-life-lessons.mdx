👋 Hello friend,

today I want to share with you, 8 life lessons I learned this week. Enjoy! 🍕

## 🏋️‍♀️ Don't focus on consumption. Focus on implementation.

What is the point of reading a blog post or book, when after one day 90% of the information is already forgotten? I'd rather take **one lesson that resonated with me the most, and apply it into practice.** (something I am still working on) 🧱🏗

## 💁‍♀️ From me me me to you you you

When feeling uncomfortable in social situations, I try to switch from thinking about me, on **focusing on the person I am talking to**. I put my full attention into the conversation.

I try to remind myself: **Everyone thinks about themselves.** There will be no person thinking about the "stupid" thing you have said or done one hour ago.

## 🧽 Things you are procrastinating on are not as hard as you may think

When I have a thought about something I am procrastinating on, I ask myself:

**Do I know for sure it will be as difficult as I imagine?** Is my brain just making up future scenarios?

I gently push the thought aside. I will find out when actually doing it.

📵 Expanding my comfort zone: Embracing boredom by making it through the day without a phone

As you may be aware, I am undergoing 31 activities that force me to step outside of my comfort zone. 🧗‍♀️ I’ve already done the following: 30. Do 1000 push ups in one day 31. Draw a picture and sell it on eBay 4. Make a YouTube video and post it

## ⏳ There won't be a time without any problems

But I have the choice, what to think about the problem I encounter. How to react. How I react to a problem will depend **in which state I am.** This is why I try to be in a good state as often as possible. You never know when the next challenge will arise.

Why I genuinely believe that problems are a great thing to have

Today I decided to reflect on the last 3 major problems I had in the past. Things that didn’t go my way. 🤔 So I asked myself the question: What did the problems lead to? How did I behave when encountering the problems? What did I learn from them? I finally

It feels a little weird posting this video. Especially imagining friends watching it. But I guess that's the drawback when publishing online. **It is in German, about how to take action and get different results than before.** Feel free to skip it, if you had enough weekly motivation. 😉

## 👊 Strategies to stay calm, when you just want to punch the other person in the face

When I get angry at a person, I ask myself:

*   What might have happened in the person's life to make him/her react like this?
*   What past experiences shaped the way the person think's like this?

These questions help to **dissociate myself from overwhelming emotions and switch position.** What triggers us, is mostly what we have in ourselves, too.

## 🤡 A structured week with theme days.

> _One of the best things I ever did to make sure I stayed on top of all of what I had going on was to_ **_assign each of the days of the week a general theme._** _By doing this, I gave my mind clues as to what to place precedence on each day before I even have to look at my to do list. So instead of my mind asking a loaded question (“What do I have to do today?”) it now asks a question that has fewer possibilities by default_ **_(“It’s Monday, so it’s Blogging Day. What tasks do I need/want to do that fall under that theme?”)_**

If you have a day where you are going to study, this post will help.

Active Recall: This is the most effective study method (after +100 years of research)

🧪 The Theory and Evidence behind active Recall Active recall is actively engaging and using cognitive effort to retrieve information to answer a question. It improves the ability to recall information in the future and strengthens connections between information in our brains. A study from 2013 l…

## 🍂 Have a focus paper next to you.

If I am working on an important task and a great idea strikes me. Or I remember that I forgot to buy curly fries for my baby elephant that I hide under my bed - **I write it down on my focus paper.**

This is a **blank sheet of paper where I write down all the things my brain thinks are important** when actually wanting to focus on deep work.

I come back to it at the end of my study session. Most of the time it isn't that great of an idea anyways, and I remember that my brain is just seeking distraction.  
However, sometimes it is real. I have to go buy some curly fries now. 🍟

Have a great week!

xx Lukas
