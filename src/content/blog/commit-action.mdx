👋 Hello Friend

I am willing to invest a lot for my productivity. How much would you be willing to spend to be 10,20 or even 50% more productive?

The power of accountability transcends these dreams.

> “Just the knowledge of the possibility of impending accountability check ins increases positive behaviors by 50%.” [(Oussedik et al., 2017)](https://www.dovepress.com/accountability-a-missing-construct-in-models-of-adherence-behavior-and-peer-reviewed-fulltext-article-PPA)

> “Virtual, weekly accountability check-ins conducted by skilled facilitators more than doubles adherence to plans to achieve goals.” [(Oussedik et al., 2017)](https://www.dovepress.com/accountability-a-missing-construct-in-models-of-adherence-behavior-and-peer-reviewed-fulltext-article-PPA) [(Kast & Pomeranz, 2014)](https://www.hbs.edu/ris/Publication%20Files/14-001_2237a8d2-6147-4667-9396-cd5ae9702f03.pdf)

The last weeks since I started having 30-minutes weekly accountability meetings (always same weekday & time) with my Commit Action coach, have been absolutely amazing. 

I stepped into my fears.

2 Things I really struggled with was pre-recording a youtube video for my new videocourse and posting the first time again on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/neurohackingly/).

**Why pay for an accountability coach when you can do it on your own?**

Perhaps you already have a weekly ritual in which you review the past week and plan the coming one. This however at least for me, only works when I "feel like doing it".

An Accountability Coach holds you accountable even when times get tough. My Commit Action Coach helps me to step out of my comfort zone, but still has the sensitivity to realize when I'm aiming too high.

### **🎯Creating your 1-year, 3-month, 1 month and weekly goals.** 

#### **1-year goal**

The center to which I come back every week is my Commit Action Dashboard. 

The first goal we defined was my one year goal, my BHAG, my big hairy audacious goal. 

I want to be honest with you and give you a little sneak peak into the goal-setting process and what a yearly goal might look like. This is my one year goal:

_April 2025 - BHAG -7k CHF/monthly profit + 200 people on online community + Automated systems + Consistent Passive income = Why: Working only 10 hours/week + Freedom to Travel and meet knowledgeable people_

Now we break down the 1-year goal into a 3-month goal. 

> Balancing big picture vs ultra-detailed goals is a skill that actually improves self control, correlating with higher earning potential, better health and even better relationships. [(Fujita, 2008)](https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2016-14492-021)

#### **3-month goal**

The 3-month goal builds upon your 1-year goal. 

_July 15 - Coaching - 4k CHF/monthly + 50 people in community + Delegating copywriting + Automate business funnel_

As you can see, the goal is measurable and contains concrete numbers. 

> Measuring—and staying conscious of—your progress against an intended goal activates the insula region of your brain when you deviate, which correlates with motivation to get back on track. [(Knutsont et al., 2007)](https://www.cell.com/neuron/fulltext/S0896-6273\(06\)00904-4?_returnURL=https%3A%2F%2Flinkinghub.elsevier.com%2Fretrieve%2Fpii%2FS0896627306009044%3Fshowall%3Dtrue)

My coach also asked me which 2 things I would like to delegate because sooner or later I want to work on my business and not in it. 

#### **Three 1-month goals**

Building on my 3-month goal we set 3 one-month goals, which each have different subject areas: Marketing, Online Course and Online Community. 

_May 15 - Marketing - 2-3/weekly post on Instagram + Build blog posts (SEO)_

_May 15 - Coaching Course - 15 hours weekly building = 10 people review it for feedback_

_May 15 - Online Community - 10 hours weekly building = Beta Version Live send to 250 newsletter members_

I have a dashboard on which I see a summary of the milestones, aka goals I created. 

There is a "Committed Tasks" section beneath it. This contains the tasks I have committed to this week. These are 3 tasks, each one relating to one og the three 1-month goals.

![my 3 weekly goals with subtasks commit action](/images/commit-action/A0FB9C05-8E55-4A3F-BA2A-F27634AFD029.jpeg)

**The 3 weekly committed are chunked down by substeps.**

This process is called Ideal Implementation Granularity. Ideal Implementation Granularity means breaking tasks into just the right size to be clear and manageable, but not too detailed to become overwhelming or inflexible.

> Specificity optimized goals always outperform, are more unconsciously motivating and build mastery faster than purely focusing on the long term. [(Bandura & Schunk, 1981)](https://psycnet.apa.org/record/1982-07527-001)

In the Uncommitted Tasks section, I write the potential upcoming Committed Tasks. The Uncommitted Tasks are analyzed and selected for Committed Tasks in the weekly accountability-session with my coach.

At the end of the weekly meeting, we schedule the tasks into the calendar.

> Adding a specific intention to take action at a precise time more than doubles the likelihood of a goal being accomplished. [(Milne et al., 2002)](https://doi.org/10.1348/135910702169420)

**What is the one thing I learned with Commit Action that has caused the biggest "aha moment"?**

Initially, it's all about getting the reps in. Don’t think: “the task has to be big enough to achieve my long term goal.” The task has to be small enough to get you starting and getting the repetitions in to build momentum. Then, after time you can step by step enlarge the tasks. 

## To Sum Up 🚀

It is some money to spend on, but it’s worth the feeling when you leave the meeting with high leverage and concrete next steps that you now simply have to work through. 

If you want to **get off 200$ of your next month of accountability coaching** at Commit Action, [use my personal link. 🔗](https://commitaction.com/?utm_campaign=referral&content=Lukas_Zangerl&utm_source=QtZfR4fj6wLfrdFfE&token=4846f6147455868)

Both you and I benefit - it's a win-win! I tried it for a month and really love it. Above all, the scientifically proven approach behind it really convinced me.

Have a great week ☀️
