👋 Hello friend

**For years I have been experimenting with establishing the perfect productive evening routine. ✨️**

Great [books like Atomic Habits](https://amzn.to/3H7ijz7) helped me implement those habits into my evening routine. I recently stumbled across [a podcast episode from Tim Ferris](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T2r1jyhT2vg) and the author of Atomic Habits, James Clear, where they share some helpful tips on implementing habits for the new year.

_Note: This is my ideal evening routine, unfortunately not yet fully established, as you can tell by the time the email reaches you._ 😉

## 🌛 My productive evening routine: Daily Schedule

#### 4.00 PM: No more caffeinated drinks

No caffeinated drinks after 4 PM because caffeine has a half-life of 6 hours or more. This can keep you awake.

#### 6.00 PM: 20 minutes run immediately after coming home

Change into the prepared running outfit and run for about 20 minutes (laying in bed and scrolling through social media = game over)

#### 6.30 PM: Cold exposure in the lake or shower for 2 minutes

#### 7.00 PM: Cooking and enjoying a meal while mindfully eating. (no Youtube, Instagram, etc.)

[Headspace](https://www.headspace.com/) has excellent guided meditations for every scenario in life, like mindful eating.  

#### 8.00 PM: Do 2 - 3 administrative tasks

#### 8.30 PM: Study time till 10.00 PM

Use active recall of what I learned today and prepare for tomorrow.

If I encounter one of the 15 most common study problems, I look at the cheat sheet on my [Studying Page.](/studying/)

#### 9.00 PM: Turn off all lights from the ceiling 🔝 and dim lights shining from the side.

Twitter Post from @hubermanlab

On my computer, a blue-light blocker (F.lux for Windows) automatically activates, and my phone switches to sleep mode.

#### 10.00 PM Wind down time

Read a fiction book, and occasionally yawn - as it fools the body into thinking you are tired (even if you are not)

#### 11.00 PM: Sleep 😴

**The best book on Sleep**: [Why We Sleep](https://amzn.to/3w74Jpe)

Listen to **my podcast episode** on [how to optimize your sleep.](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3KnSZYdry99j3bVSW1cH68?si=0f3305ebe78c4864)

I hope you found the evening routine helpful and can pick some elements from it to integrate into your evening routine.

Have a great week!

xx Lukas
