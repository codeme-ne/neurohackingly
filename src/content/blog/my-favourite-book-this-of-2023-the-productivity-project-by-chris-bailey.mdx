According to Chris Bailey's book [The Productivity Project](https://amzn.to/3Err84L), true productivity is **accomplishing meaningful work in less time** rather than just getting more done in less time.

## 6 Things I learned about Productivity after reading [The Productivity Project](https://amzn.to/3Err84L) by Chris Bailey

### Know your why: Why do you want to become productive?

Will you use the time gained to squeeze in more work or revitalize and relax?

### Reflect on the past and [plan the future week](/weekly-review/).

Questions you can ask yourself:

*   What needs **more of** my time, energy, and focus?
*   What did I spend **too much time** on?
*   What do I need to **add to my to-do list**?
*   Are there any **new opportunities**?
*   Are there any **new challenges**?
*   **Am I happy** with where I'm going?

### Avoid scheduling shallow work.

The very process of scheduling "non-important tasks" gives them importance. Focus on 60-90 minute deep-work blocks. Try doing shallow work in between.

### Use the 90% Rule to eliminate unimportant tasks.

The 90% Rule: For each to-do on your list, ask yourself: How important and fulfilling is this task on a scale of 1-100? Eliminate if score < 90.

### Monotask.

Task switching isn't just an energy drainer. [Studies show](https://www.forbes.com/sites/travisbradberry/2014/10/08/multitasking-damages-your-brain-and-career-new-studies-suggest/?sh=3c25146556ee) that it can lead to brain damage and lower IQ.

### Use energy spikes for "high impact tasks" and energy lows to recover.

I schedule "health blocks" in my calendar as high-impact tasks and even used to track my energy levels every hour to find out daily peaks and lows. ([When](https://amzn.to/45ZDc8X), by Daniel Pink)
