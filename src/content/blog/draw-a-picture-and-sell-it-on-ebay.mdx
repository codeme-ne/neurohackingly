Proud "artist"

_Please don't take this too seriously._ 🙂

I made it through the first day and the first challenge. I'm proud of myself, **not because of the result, but because I haven't drawn in ages and have been wanting to for some time.** I have always thought that I don't have time for it and ... why should I even draw?

Now I have noticed again what a nice feeling it is to be 100% immersed in what you are doing. **Just doing something with your hands and not really thinking about it.** While drawing, a quote somehow came to my mind:

> "Journey before destination."

Fun fact: My picture is now really on eBay, however, I had to advertise it for 5 euros, since the shipping costs alone are 4.95 euros lol. Maybe I'll eventually buy it off myself.
