**Science-backed information to forming and sticking to daily practices for 30 days and beyond.**

## 🚗 EXTRINSIC VS INTRINSIC

Ask yourself if there are external factors, such as Facebook likes and Instagram comments that push you to go running, or internal factors, such as feeling healthy and happy. Internal motivation is far more effective in the long run.

## 🔮 ANTICIPATE

Thinking about the habit you want to implement into your life - **What challenges could you face in the next 30 days?** Take a look at your calendar and see what events are coming up. How will you manage to fast every day until the early evening, when there is a hot dog eating contest next weekend?

## 🌲 ENVIRONMENT

Control your environment by not buying sweets or removing them from your house to avoid temptation. Make it easy for your future self by putting out your running shoes and clothes the day before. Consequently, you **don't have to think much** and can just jump into them in the morning.

## 🍪 REWARDS & ANTI REWARDS

What can you already look forward to once you've managed to integrate a habit for 30 days? How will you **reward yourself**? What will happen if you quit? Anti-rewards can be a strong driver too.

## 💪🏼 ACCOUNTABILITY BUDDY

Do you have an accountability buddy or coach who will work with you to establish a new habit? Arrange to meet weekly and give each other updates on how you are doing. Which challenges are you currently facing? The weekly support will help a lot to **keep going** and recognize that you are not the only one (maybe) struggling a little bit.

## ❌ HABIT TRACKER

Use your Habit Tracker and make an "X" each day, when you completed the habit you want to implement. Don't be too hard on yourself. If you have a bad day or can't find the time, give yourself a day off. But remember the **2-day-rule** to stay consistent: Don't let yourself take 2 days off in a row.
