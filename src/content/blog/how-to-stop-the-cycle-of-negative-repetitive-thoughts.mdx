I have been interested in stopping the Cycle of Negative Repetitive Thoughts for a long time.

And over the past 6 years, I have come across a lot of quick self-help fixes.

At first I agreed with them, and then the more I learned and educated myself the more I disagreed with them. Until eventually, I reached a point where I felt like the only reason these quick-fixes had become mainstream and commonly accepted was because “a lot of other people” agreed with them too.

## **So, I have some unique hacks I’d like to share on How to stop the Cycle of Negative Repetitive Thoughts after 10 000 hours immersing myself in the subject:**

## 🔐 Mentally lock up your thoughts (and come back to them later)

#1: Imagine putting your racing thoughts into a safe and lock them up.

#2: Tell yourself that you will come back to them in the evening.

#3: Schedule a no more than 15 minute window in your calendar.

#4: In this window write down everything that comes up to your problem.

Repeat.

## 👏 Tap your chest, hum, roll your eyes (separate or simultaneously)

**#1:** Tap the upper chest area with your fingertips.

**#2:** While doing this hum so that the whole head vibrates.

**#3:** Combine it with smoothly rolling your eyes in circles.

**#4:** Look far out in the corner of your vision, while keeping the head straight.
