[Free Quarterly Reflection & Planning Event in German.](https://www.landsiedel-seminare.de/anmeldung/as/nlp-webinar-tv/index.html?seminar_typ=NLP%20Webinar%20TV&seminar_id=3940)

This Wednesday, 2025-03-26.

8:15 PM.

We'll reflect on 2025 so far, adjust course, and plan for upcoming months.

Now to today's newsletter.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​

We're spending our lives staring at screens.

But there are two fundamentally different types of screens.

Understanding the difference changed how I approach digital life.

CONSUMPTION SCREENS

These are the ones that feed you.

Social media, news sites, video platforms, and endless streams of content.

They're designed to pull you in and keep you engaged.

They make money when you keep scrolling.

They employ thousands of engineers who optimize for your continued attention.

They're built to be addictive.

I noticed how I felt after using these screens:

*   scattered,
*   anxious,
*   unsatisfied.

CREATION SCREENS

These are the ones you feed.

Text editors, programming environments, design tools.

Empty canvases waiting for your input.

They're designed for production, not consumption.

They don't profit from your prolonged attention.

They serve your goals, not theirs.

I noticed how I felt after using these screens:

*   focused,
*   accomplished,
*   energized.

THE RATIO

Most people spend 90% of their screen time consuming and 10% creating.

I deliberately reversed this ratio.

I now spend most of my screen time making things.

I limit consumption to specific times, with clear boundaries.

Each morning, I open a text editor before any browser or app.

I create before I consume.

This simple change has dramatically increased my output and satisfaction.

The internet becomes a tool instead of a trap.

Your screen time doesn't need to decrease.

It just needs to flip direction.

Have a great week,

Lukas
