Hello friend,

This week I was reminded again of how important it is to have only a few clear goals.

> "We can have anything, but not everything." — David Allen

This hit me while reading Justin Welsh's newsletter, ["The Hidden Cost of Being Perfect."](https://www.justinwelsh.me/newsletter/the-hidden-cost-of-being-perfect?utm_source=convertkit&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=The%20hidden%20cost%20of%20being%20perfect%20-%2016859147)

The message was clear: **it is impossible to perfect everything—and trying to do so comes at a high cost.**

Soon after, I found an article by Mark Manson called ["How to Be More Productive (While Working Less)."](https://markmanson.net/how-to-be-more-productive)

As with a good productivity system, it is often a matter of **reminding ourselves of the important things over and over again.** I read a whole book about the importance of working strategically and prioritizing rest, called [Rest, by Alex Pang](https://amzn.to/3FKTNp5). However, I often find myself working long hours late into the night. 😖

I was happy to read that Mark Manson says that after about 3-4 hours of work, it's best to stop working. After a while, our output declines, leading to more mistakes and extra work.

> "Make those 3-4 hours where you're most productive in the day count. The rest is a bonus." - Mark Manson

Yet, I still feel like I lack time to fit everything into those productive hours. This is when Productivity Angel Ali Abdaal sat on my shoulder and reminded me:

### **No productivity system can help us do it all. A good system focuses on what is important to us and helps us get it done.**

And the one thing that will transform your focus is tracking your focus minutes.

Since I started tracking my time with toggl.com and updating my calendar nightly, I see how I spend every minute. Leading a [12-week productivity course](https://www.produktiv.me/werkstatt) lets me test and apply the concepts I teach again and again, which is great.

Tracking my time for several months now allows me to pinpoint [my 20% High-Impact Tasks](https://www.justinwelsh.me/newsletter/boost-your-biz-pinpoint-your-20-high-impact-tasks), using the exercise from Justin Welsh's post. But more on that next week.

Have a productive week!
