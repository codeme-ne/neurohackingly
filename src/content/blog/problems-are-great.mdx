Today I decided to reflect on the last 3 major problems I had in the past. Things that didn't go my way.

🤔 So I asked myself the question: What did the problems lead to? How did I behave when encountering the problems? What did I learn from them?

I finally came to the conclusion: **Problems are great!**

## 😍 Here's why problems are a great thing to have

Problems show **what is important to you** right now.

Problems reflect **your needs**. They let you focus on the most **essential.**

Problems get you to **take immediate action.**

Problems boost **positive feelings** and make you **appreciate them.**

Problems let you be **grateful for what you have.**

Problems **prepare you** for bigger challenges which will come in the future.

Problems bring **new insights** and let you experience a new **way of thinking**.

Problems let you **share your experiences** with others.

Problems make up **great stories**. Or would you like to watch a movie without a problem the main character has to solve?

Problems **create variety**. No problem. No solution.

Problems lead to **great things.**

🌄 Sooner or later I have always **experienced things and moments I am now most grateful for** - through having a problem.
