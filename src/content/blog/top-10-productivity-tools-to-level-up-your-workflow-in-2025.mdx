Hello friend 👋

This is a list of productivity tools I've been hiding for some time. 

As a New Year's gift, I want to share them with you.  

An ultimate productivity tool list. 

These will blow you away. 

No kidding. 

## 🖥️ **10 Powerful Productivity Tools to level-up your workflow in 2025**

**#1.** [**Screenity**](https://github.com/alyssaxuu/screenity)**:** A powerful Loom alternative for creating screen recordings. It offers advanced features like annotation, editing, and exporting—all for free.

**#2.** [**ShareX Screenshot App**](https://getsharex.com/)**:** Take screenshots, recognize text using OCR, and edit captures. Perfect for documenting and sharing visual information.

**#3.** [**Clipboard Help+Spell**](https://www.donationcoder.com/software/mouser/popular-apps/clipboard-help-and-spell)**:** Saves everything you copy to your clipboard. Makes it easy to retrieve lost content.

**#4.** [**Everything**](https://www.voidtools.com/he-il/support/everything/searching/)**:** My go-to filename search engine for Windows. Check it out. 

**#5.** [**Espanso**](https://espanso.org/)**:** Textexpanders detect when you type a keyword. E.g. ":date" Then it replaces it while you are typing. -> "30.12.2024". Super handy for repetitive phrases. 

**#6.** [**Tide**](https://tide.fm/en_US/): A timer that combines pomodoro with nature sounds.

**#7.** [**Akiflow**](https://akiflow.com/): Crazy productivity tool to have everything in one place: calendar, to-do lists... On the expensive side though.
