    10 Takeaways + 5 Bonus Insights!

I have listened to over 100 audio programs on self development systems. These eight audiobooks by Tony Robbins are **my absolute favorites.**

## Over 100 hours later, here are my top 10 takeaways

**1.❌ Stop making to-do lists**. Instead, ask yourself:

*   **What result** do I want?
*   **Why must** I achieve it?

**2\. 🙏 Evaluate your belief system. Does it support you?** Old: If I don't get what I want, I failed. New: If I keep trying, I have not failed yet. I have only failed if I quit trying.

**3.** ⚡ **Practice** **constant pattern interruption to overcome your fear.** Also, choose a new association. Otherwise, your surroundings will.

**4\. 🗣 Stop affirmations. Use incantations.** By using your full body and voice doing power walks. Fully embody, shout and immerse into it.

**5\. 🤏 Don't major in minor things.** Focus on the fulfilling and big moments you want to experience. Save the little things, creating quick hits of dopamine and certainty, for later.

**6\. 💞 The quality of your life is the quality of your habitual emotions** \- your emotional home. A person can have lots of money, friends, and wealth. If his habitual emotions are fear and stress, he will have a fearful and stressed-out life.

**7\. 🏇 Excitement must lead to immediate action.** The 72-hour rule states: If you don't take action within the next 72 hours, the probability that you will ever take action is close to zero.

**8\. 🛳 If you want to take the island burn the boats:** I applied this when running a marathon. I signed up but didn't get the cancellation insurance to make sure I wouldn't cancel the race.

**9.** 🐫 List the **top 2 negative and top 2 positive feelings** **you experience in an average week.** What step-by-step process do you have to do to achieve these emotions?

**10\.** 💥 I now use **powerful words to get into action.** Like outstanding, life-changing, or transforming. Okay, I have to go do my breathtaking laundry now. 😉
