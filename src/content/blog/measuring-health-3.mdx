👋 Hello Friend

This is the third newsletter of my personal Health Series.

*   [Measuring Health 1.0](/measuring-health/) (03/03/2024)
*   [Measuring Health 2.0](/measuring-health-2-0/) (20/05/2024)

What follows is an update on whether I have been able to improve my health data and achieve the goals I set myself.

## 🏔️Overview - As in previous issues, I will proceed according to the following structure

*   Goal setting, facts about the goals I set
*   Comparison of whether I have achieved the goals
*   Plan and system I had for achieving my goals

Finally, I will set my health goals for the end of 2024 and will provide you with another report.

### 🎯These were my goals from May 2024

*   Reduce body fat to 16% - not achieved, body fat ∆ +0.3%
*   Improve posture, aiming for a more upright neck position – a nose length difference - achieved, inclination between head and shoulder ∆ Ø 6.6°

### 🏆My in September 2024 – Achievements

*   Muscle mass +1.8kg
    *   Shoulder circumference ∆ +4.7cm
    *   Chest circumference ∆ +2.0cm

*   Posture – The inclination (R) between head and shoulder has improved from 10.8° to 4.6°, with a difference of 6.2°. The inclination (L) has even improved from 12° to 5° with a difference of 7.0°! 😍
    *   I am very pleased about this, as I have been working intensively on my posture for the last 5 months and have been doing the following 2 exercises once or twice a week:
        *   Suboccipital Exercise (2x per week, 1 set)
        *   Levator Scapula Exercise (2x per week, 1 set)

*   Position of the shoulders – The left shoulder was 1.4 cm higher than the right shoulder. Now the left shoulder is only 0.7cm higher than the right shoulder.
    *   Reason: I can't prove whether this is true or not, but I have been paying more attention to the fact that I no longer carry my rucksack on my right shoulder only. I either alternate between right and left shoulder, or I carry it on both shoulders.

### ☝️Room for improvement

I trained my legs almost every workout and went running regularly, which is why I am not satisfied with the results of my leg circumferences.

*   Legs
    *   Thigh circumference ∆ Ø +0.8cm
    *   Calf circumference ∆ 0cm
*   Tummy
    *   Waist, stomach & hips ∆ increased

## ⏭️Further procedures

We are now heading into winter.

I would like to gain mass, ideally 1.0 kg of lean mass by 31.12.2024. As I will now be using my [training plan from Peter Attila](https://honehealth.com/edge/peter-attia-workout-routine/) for the next 3 months and this includes many basic exercises such as deadlifts, squats and bench presses, I will gain a good amount of mass.

Nevertheless, I don't want to exceed a body fat percentage of 17%, as visceral fat is an important indicator of health.

### 🎯Goals until 31.12.2024

*   Body fat: less than 17%
*   Lean mass: +1kg

## Summary

I have built up muscle mass, although there is also a little gain in bodyfat percentage. Posture has improved significantly.

Have a great week!
