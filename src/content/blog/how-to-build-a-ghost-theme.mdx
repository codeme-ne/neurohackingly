I love learning about **Web Development.**

Unfortunately, when I first got interested in building a theme for ghost.org, I had a hard time figuring out where to start.

What is Ghost? I would describe Ghost as a modern and more efficient alternative to Wordpress.

## If you are trying to learn more about how to build a ghost theme here's the best way to get started

**Read This Blog:** [**Byron Themes**](https://bironthemes.com/blog/)

I love the short and immediately applicable blog posts_._ They give you new ideas on what you can integrate into your website.

**Watch this Video-Class:** [**Customize Your Theme Publication**](https://www.skillshare.com/de/classes/Ghost-Theme-Development-How-to-Customise-Your-Ghost-Publication/1570520217/lessons)

A step-by-step Skillshare Course by Christopher Dodd. Together with him, you create a Ghost Theme from scratch. You learn primarily about the structure of Ghost.org theme.

**Listen To This Podcast:** [**The Laracast Snippet**](https://laracasts.com/podcast)

Just had to share this, even though it is not specifically for Ghost Theme Development. Jeffrey Way talks in each episode about a single thought on some aspect of Web Development.

These 3 resources will exponentially accelerate your learning process.

**Have you always wanted to write a blog, too?** Check out my blog post [👻 Building a Blog with Ghost (Overview)](/ghost-org-overview/) to look at many more **awesome features** that the platform brings with it.
