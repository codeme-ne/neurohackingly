👋 Hello friend

With 4.21 ⭐ and over 18.000 ratings, [A Mind for Numbers](https://amzn.to/3iUn7P7) is the best-rated book on Goodreads in the category "learning how to learn."

If you don't want to read the whole book, I highly suggest listening to [the 17-minute Ted Talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O96fE1E-rf8&t).

## 10 key takeaways of the book [A Mind for Numbers](https://amzn.to/3iUn7P7)

1.  💭 **Visualize the situation when you might use the concepts** you are studying now. How will you apply this in the future?
2.  🚫 **Is this information really relevant**, or can I skip this?
3.  🦖 **Sit in the T-section during class.** [Studies have found](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0013916580122008) that students sitting in front and in the middle rows are most engaged and receive better grades. (even though they weren't more enthusiastic about the course before)
4.  🎮 **Do not multitask.** Trying to listen and simultaneously researching something on the web is considered multitasking. (and exhausting)
5.  🌍 **Focus on the main concepts and key ideas** instead of trying to record everything.
6.  🙂 **Make it enjoyable.** Written on a sticky note on my laptop.
7.  ⏳ **It is normal to have a bad feeling when sitting down to study**; go past the first few minutes and remind yourself that everyone has this feeling.
8.  💚 **Passion is not developed when starting something new.** Passion is developed after practice and over time.
9.  🚞 **If you are a slow learner trying to learn faster is the wrong approach.** Remember that the hiker sees the bees and butterflies (= more profound knowledge), unlike the racecar.
10.  🤹‍♀️ **You know something telling when to and when not to use the concept.** Also, when you have access to the information at a specific moment, you need it. This is only developed by practice.
