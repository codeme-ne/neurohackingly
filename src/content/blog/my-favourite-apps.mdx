## 🔨 Gadgets and tools I use

🌞🎧 [Bose QuietComfort Ultra Earbuds](https://amzn.to/45bXc7z) I use in summer. I actually always have them in my ears. While learning, cooking, running, etc.

⛄🎧 [Bose QuietComfort 45 Headphones](https://amzn.to/3ZCDK2z) I use in winter. (they keep my ears warm)

📕 For reading, I love to use the [Kindle Paperwhite (16 GB).](https://amzn.to/46mRSjj)

💻 I am a fanboy of the Logitec MX Master Series. I own the [MX ANYWHERE 3S](https://amzn.to/3RCW3mh) mouse and [MX KEYS MINI](https://amzn.to/3rtB5M8) keyboard.

## Apps

Here, you can find apps that I use nearly daily.

### 📖 Reading

[Shortform](https://www.shortform.com/neurohackingly) - is the best book summary platform I know of. It provides one-page and extensive per-chapter summaries, audio narration, articles, and highlights.

I've been using Shortform for a while and now I’ve partnered with them as an affiliate! Use [my link for a 20% discount on the annual subscription](shortform.com/neurohackingly). That’s about 2 and half months of the service for free.

[Kindle](https://amzn.to/3g0fll9) - Did you know there is a Kindle app? - great for reading full books on your phone.

[Audible](https://amzn.to/3g9aKx0) (30-day free trial + 1 free audiobook) - **the single app I have used most often**,. When I get a book recommendation, I usually add it to my favorites on Audible after reading the summary on Shortform

[Medium](https://medium.com/@neurohackingly) - a platform with a lot of great articles about all different kinds of topics. Click the Medium Link to follow me. :)

[Readwise](https://readwise.io/i/lukas095) - connects with and **saves highlighted sentences** from your favorite reading apps like Kindle or Shortform. You can also **regularly receive highlights** you made on your Kindle by email. No more "highlighted and forgotten."

[Instapaper](https://www.instapaper.com/) - in [this article](https://fortelabs.co/blog/the-secret-power-of-read-it-later-apps/), Tiago Forte talks about the dark side of constantly reacting to outer stimuli. With Instapaper, we can save interesting articles and read them later.

If you want to know how to quickly and easily save articles, social media posts, YouTube videos, and podcast episodes for later, this video has a good explanation. We look at **how to use the best read-later app I know of.**

### 📓 Note-taking

[Notion](https://www.notion.so/product?utm_source=google&utm_campaign=2075789713&utm_medium=80211061801&utm_content=453572180157&utm_term=notion&targetid=aud-1188813422817:kwd-312974742&gclid=CjwKCAjwmJeYBhAwEiwAXlg0Af933OYpq7Y1f9F61QqcquCCaJlPmnbZqs99ONZ9VL8ZvuheQPd2RxoCpRQQAvD_BwE) - My favourite note-taking app, which serves as [my second brain](/how-to-build-a-second-brain/). Listen to [this episode](https://rss.com/podcasts/lernenlernen/558484/) if you want to find out more.

[Evernote](https://evernote.com/intl/de) - The note-taking app I use to capture notes before they get transferred into my second brain. The Evernote search function is very impressive. It searches in PDFs, pictures, and even handwritten notes.

[ToDoist](https://todoist.com/home?gspk=c2VtYW50aWNsYWJzNzMxNw&gsxid=xLX4ywSbbG9K&sid=1-g-CjwKCAjwmJeYBhAwEiwAXlg0AcEmAQAFFgklQ1BjcADp7mt4wV1mLvLr4_LFvH0sfsHrYlhddAeHsBoCTrQQAvD_BwE&utm_campaign=strategic_partner&utm_content=semanticlabs7317&utm_medium=strategic_partner&utm_source=partnerstack) - quick capture app of tasks to do.

[DAYONE](https://dayoneapp.com/) - has such a nice, simple design. I like how the font looks. It shows you how many times in a row you have made a diary entry. This is motivating.

### 🤓 Studying

[Forest](https://www.forestapp.cc/) - The Pomodoro technique is a powerful technique where you concentrate for 25 minutes on a task, followed by a 5 minutes break. It lets you track your progress with planting one tree per "pom session".

[Wingwave](https://wingwave.com/wingwave-app/) - positive melodies, mainly due to a left-right beat, decrease stress and increase creativity and concentration. [How it works.](https://wingwave-shop.com/en/pages/so-wirkt-wingwave-musik)

It has different meditation categories like Managing anxiety, Focus, Creativity, Balance, and so many more.

[f.lux](https://justgetflux.com/) - adapts the color of your computer's display, sunlight during the day, and warmth at night. Click here if you want to find out more about [how to improve your sleep.](https://rss.com/podcasts/lernenlernen/576437/)
