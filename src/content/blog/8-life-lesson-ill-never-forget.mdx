👋 Hello friend,

This weekend I learned some **exceptional life lessons I'll never forget.**

It was in May 2022 that I saw that Christian Bischoff is coming to Zurich. I was excited to attend a live event with **hundreds of others** interested in personal growth.

At first, I was skeptical, but over time, I was taken by the mood of the stadium. **A seminar is what you make of it.**

### 🌳 Lesson #1: You don't notice the immediate effects of small habit changes.

At some point, however, there is an **exponential effect of all the small seeds you scattered**.

### 👼 Lesson #2: "The face is the index of the mind."

When negative thoughts rule your day, your peers may not notice it immediately. However, **over time your face will reveal the consequences** (latest at 40 years old 😉).

### 🐙 Lesson #3: "To whom you assign blame, you assign power."

As soon as you place **blame on the outside, you give up responsibility.** If the goal is to have someone else control how you feel, that's the way.

### 💪 Lesson #4: You are afraid because you have not done it often enough.

Also, when **remaining passive**. If you take immediate action, you will experience fear at first, followed by self-confidence.

### 😪 Lesson #5: What is the worst feeling?

*   Having no meaning.
*   Having no purpose.

[This study](https://bmcpsychiatry.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12888-020-02485-4) demonstrates that the presence of meaning in life and the search for meaning are protective measures against suicide.

### 🔐 Lesson #6: How do you find meaning in life? (you pick which one)

*   1: Devotion to a cause (being fully absorbed into an activity)
*   2: Love for other people
*   3: Modeling a role model
*   4: Through a stroke of fate

### 👑 Lesson #7: "When the kings go, the gods come."

The right mindset for people having gone through a breakup.

### ⚓ Lesson #8: Working with space anchoring is an effective way to influence the viewer's subconscious.

#### What Christian Bischoff did and said:

1\. "Some people have negative automations". _Takes two steps to the right._  
2\. _Goes back to the initial position_.  
3\. "Others question these automatic responses." _He takes two steps to the left._  
4\. "You have the choice." _Takes two steps to the left.  
Can you see how you will now tend to go with the second option? Would you happen to know why? 🙂_

Have a great week!

xx Lukas
