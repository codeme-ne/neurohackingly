## 😮A simple 6-step process to master any new topic

About a year ago, I applied for a writer's position at [**Shortform**](https://www.shortform.com/?utm_source=neurohackingly&utm_medium=partner)—I’m a big fan of their app.

Curious what happened? I’ll share the outcome at the end of this newsletter.

Previously, when I wanted to dive into a new topic, I would just ask ChatGPT or use Perplexity.ai. But now, for a deeper understanding, I rely on Shortform. Their summaries make it easy to filter by topic.

For example, if I’m interested in "focus," I just search for it and instantly get the best book summaries on the subject.

### ⬇️ Here's my simple 6-step process to master any new topic

**#1. Check Shortform’s New Releases**: Since they release summaries weekly, I just scroll through the "New Releases" section on the homepage. This week, I found a book called _The Power of Unwavering Focus,_ by Dandapani.

**#2. Read Goodreads Reviews**: Before deciding to get the full book, I check out the reviews on Goodreads. (Feel free to [add me as a friend](https://www.goodreads.com/friend/i?feature=friend-invite-url&invite_token=ZThiYjczMjgtYjVkNi00ODZjLTg5ZjYtNThmM2ZiODRkOWRj) there!)

**#3. Read the 1-Page Summary**: If I’m still hooked, I read the 1-page summary on Shortform. It only takes about 10 minutes.

**#4. Read the Full Summary**: If it keeps my interest, I dive into the full summary. I highlight any key ideas, which automatically sync with my [Readwise](https://readwise.io/) account.

**#5. Do the Practical Exercises**: I always like to test my knowledge using Shortform's exercises and questions.

**#6. Buy the Book if I’m Impressed**: If a book really stands out—like _The Power of Unwavering Focus_ by Dandapani—I buy the full version on Kindle.

## What Is Shortform?

Think of Shortform as book summaries, but better. They cover all the key points from a book, plus they add helpful analysis and commentary.

**It’s like having a really smart friend explain the book to you.**

I use Shortform on both my laptop and phone. Before, I’d reach for Instagram or Reddit when I had downtime.

Now, I open Shortform instead—it’s my go-to app when I want to quickly learn something new.

### Remember How I Applied to Shortform? Here’s What Happened

Unfortunately, they didn’t need new writers at the time.

But now, I’m an affiliate for them! I've always been a fan and a paying customer, so this was a natural fit for me.

Want to try Shortform? You can get a **FREE trial** and an extra 20% discount on the annual subscription through my special link: [shortform.com/neurohackingly](https://shortform.com/neurohackingly).

## 🧰 Top 3 Windows tools to save you hours each week

**#1.** [**Workona**](https://workona.com/)  
A tab manager that lets you save groups of tabs you frequently use. For example, I have a "Morning Ritual" setup with 5 tabs. I just click one button, and they all open at once. Unfortunately, the free version limits you to five spaces. Know a good free alternative? Let me know! 🙏
