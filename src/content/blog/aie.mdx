Hey,

This week, I found and tried some exciting things.

Here are my highlights:

## **AI in Practice: When It Helps – And When It Doesn't** 💡

I've been experimenting with AI a lot. My takeaway: it's not a jack-of-all-trades, but a strong assistant! AI works best when it simplifies complex ideas. For example, it can help build a RAG system with Claude or clarify different AI settings.

AI has limits for detailed tasks, such as writing academic papers or analyzing complex data. It often lacks the broad human knowledge needed to connect subtle ideas. In these cases, AI can be distracting or unhelpful.

_Personal favorite right now:_ I'm getting great results with Gemini Flash 2.5 4-17.

## **🚀 My actionable AI tip: Think in systems.**

To make AI work for you, see it as part of your workflow.

1.  **Identify:** What repetitive tasks do you do regularly?
2.  **Automate:** How can AI simplify these tasks? This might involve keyboard shortcuts for prompts. It could also mean using AI for fast explanations and research.

## **🗣️ My AI Presentation Coach (in the car!)**

I discovered something cool this week: using voice mode to chat directly with ChatGPT.

I used it as my personal presentation coach in the car. I shared my plans for each slide, and it gave feedback on what worked and what needed improvement.

## **⚙️ Productivity Resources I've Discovered:**

*   Focus Booster: Guided Study Sessions: Watch Dr. Justin Sung's YouTube video here: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZMsTMuyH7w8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZMsTMuyH7w8). It runs for 3 hours and includes guided breaks, perfect for staying focused over long periods.
*   **Lightning-Fast Transcription:** [wisprflow.ai](http://wisprflow.ai) is a simple voice-to-text tool that saves you time. Dictate, and you're done!

That's it for this week! I hope you find some useful insights here.

Have a great week.

Lukas
