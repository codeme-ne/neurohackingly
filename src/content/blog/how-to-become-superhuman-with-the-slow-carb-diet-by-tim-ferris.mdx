[The 4-Hour Body](https://amzn.to/3xZtJ2C) by Tim Ferris is a lifestyle and dietary guide on how to become superhuman.

I was especially interested because it promised **increased physical energy, mental clarity, and overall performance.** In this guide, I will provide a slow-carb diet meal plan, food list, and other important recommendations Tim Ferris mentions to understand better what the slow-carb diet is about.

## 🦸‍♂️ How to Become Superhuman with the Slow Carb Diet by Tim Ferris

After reading [**The 4-Hour Workweek**](https://amzn.to/3ENIyZW) from the author of four #1 _New York Times_ and _Wall Street Journal_ bestsellers, Tim Ferris (and thus totally transforming my productivity), I decided to give his book [**The 4 Hour Body**](https://amzn.to/3xZtJ2C) a try.

> **Kevin Kelly, Wired Magzine writes: "A cookbook of minimalist methods for rapid body transformation - a practical crash course in how to reinvent yourself."**

### ❗ Important things to know before starting with the Slow Carb Diet

1.  Expect to eat 2-3 times more the volume you eat normally, and you should.
2.  This diet is supposed to be effective, not fun.

My groceries for the first few days of eating

These are the groceries I bought for the first few days. Probably this won't last even a week...

#### My Proteins:

2x 230g of smoked Tofu

1x 500g of Tofu nature

2x 250g Salmon

#### My Legumes:

500g white beans

500g red beans

800g black lentils

#### My Vegetables:

2 kg mixed frozen vegetables

1kg green beans

800g broccoli

#### 🐢 My Slow-Carb Diet Meal Plan

Because I want to make it as easy as possible for me, but still have a variety of flavors and want to enjoy eating, I prepared 3 Meal options for the week.

I will always try to meal prep my meals on Sunday for the whole week. This will make 18 meals (3 meals per day **x** 6 days). Saturday is my cheat day.

From the 4 Hour Body

**Meal 1:** Tofu, Black Beans, Mixed Vegetables

**Meal 2:** Salmon, Pinto Beans, Spinach

**Meal 3:** Eggs, Lentils, kimchee

**Snacks:** Peanuts, Almonds, Walnuts, Pumpkin seeds (high in potassium), carrots, eat another low-carb meal, peanut butter (ingredients: peanuts, maybe salt)

Other things to add or eat if the diet becomes too boring:

*   salsa to the eggs
*   cinnamon and vanilla

### ❌ What not to Eat and Drink

*   Milk, including soymilk
*   sugary drinks
*   fruit juice
*   fruit
*   sweeteners and sugars (spike insulin levels)
*   white carbohydrates

### 💊 Supplements

*   Potassium (or eat Avocados)
*   Calcium
*   Magnesium (500mg before sleep will also increase sleep quality)
*   Athletic Greens
*   Whey Protein

### 🌺 My Personal Experience after Starting the Slow Carb Diet

I noticed that my peaks and lows are smoother. I don't have the high energy phases I normally have after eating foods high in sugar, but I don't have the downs, either.

My problem before was why I binged when I was tired and hungry: I didn't have a strict plan for what not to do and what to eat.

Do NOT forget to:

*   Drink enough water
*   eat enough protein
