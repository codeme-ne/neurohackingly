👋 Hello Friend

As of today, October 13th, there are **80 days left in the year 2024.** What will you do with it?

**Every three months, I make it a habit to take a full day off to reflect on the past quarter and plan for the upcoming one.** This practice helps me step back from daily output & reflect on what truly matters.

During the quarterly reflection [Commit Action](https://www.commitaction.com/), I learned that many entrepreneurs experience a sense of burnout in the last quarter, which is why it is even more important not to do more, but to focus only on the things that are “high-leverage.”

> "leverage is named after a lever in physics, which amplifies a small input force into a greater output force" – [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leverage\_(finance)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leverage_\(finance\))

## 🪽 Here are the most thought provoking reflection questions to get the most out of 2024

### 🪞 Reflect on Q3 (July – September)

![](https://media.tenor.com/eomT2hRxUYIAAAAC/pooh-think.gif)

1.  What tasks were unnecessary in Q3?
2.  Which events or activities provided the highest return on investment last quarter?
3.  Are you 75% closer to where you want to be by the end of the year?
4.  How can you double down on your big wins or the momentum they've created?
5.  Was there an unexpected source of motivation or inspiration? How can you recreate it?

### 🗓️ Plan Q4 (October - December)

![](https://media.tenor.com/LUXIr9to7rIAAAAC/heres-the-plan-plan.gif)

1.  Thinking about your milestones in Q4: What if things go "merely okay"? What would that mean for 2025?
2.  What exactly are you measuring with your goal? How "guaranteed" is the outcome you desire if you achieve 100% of what you're measuring?
3.  How will 2025 be different if you focus on what matters most now?
4.  What should you stop doing or remove from your schedule? _(Take action! Break free from the "insanity cycle" of doing the same things and expecting different results.)_
5.  What time off do you want to take? Commit, schedule it, and set boundaries for yourself and others.

## 🤓 What I have learned from the reflection for Q3-2024 & the planning process for Q4-2024

1.  Effective planning starts with a thoughtful review of my past actions. By understanding what has worked and what hasn’t, I can make smarter choices moving forward.
2.  Recognizing my progress fuels my motivation and dispels the feeling that I’m stuck on an endless treadmill.
3.  Small, consistent steps lead to significant results—I need to acknowledge the impact of my daily efforts.
4.  It’s time to break away from unproductive habits. Instead of repeating the same actions and expecting different outcomes, I should try new strategies. I might be surprised at how simple changes can lead to quick and meaningful victories.
