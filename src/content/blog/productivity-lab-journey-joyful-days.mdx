👋 Hello Friend

In this week’s edition of my **Productivity Lab Journey**, I will share some tips to help you create joyful days.

*   **Creating Joyful Days:** You define what an ideal and realistic workday looks like for you.
*   **A Morning Manifesto:** A journaling exercise to start your day.
*   **An Evening Epilogue:** A journaling exercise to end your day.

* * *

## 4 Steps to Your Joyful Day

1.  **Write down your non-negotiables.**
2.  **Write down the time you need for each task.**
3.  **Sort them into your day according to your energy levels.**
4.  **Plan each day to be joyful.** Refer to your joyful day template.

Step 2 allocates time for each activity: running (30 minutes), meeting with friends (2 hours), writing (1 hour), and studying (2 hours 30 minutes). Step 3 organizes these activities visually into blocks, emphasizing time allocation: running (30 minutes), writing (1 hour), studying (2 hours 30 minutes), and meeting with friends (2 hours).](/images/productivity-lab-journey-joyful-days/exercise-your-joyful-days-neurohackingly.png)

### I try to live by this sentence: **Match energy to task** and be creative before reactive.

🕖 **Morning is Maker-Time** \-> High Energy -> High Priority = Deep work on my long-term goals

🕑 **Afternoon is Manager-Time** -> Medium Energy -> 50% energy me + 50% energy other person = 100% energy

🕕 **Early Evening is Monkey-Time** (Admin) -> Low Energy -> Admin tasks & low brain power activities

## My Morning Manifesto and Evening Epilogue

### Morning Manifesto 🌞

I ask myself these three questions before I eat breakfast:

*   **What am I grateful for?**
*   **How will I ensure I have a great day?**
*   **What tiny thing will I do today that scares me?**

### Evening Epilogue 🌜

I ask myself these three questions after brushing my teeth:

*   **What good have I done for someone today?**
*   **What did I learn today?**
*   **What great things did I experience today?**

Have a great week!

## Off-Topic

### Accountability Meeting

I have an accountability meeting each Wednesday. My friend and I try not to break the chain of winning days. A **winning day** means focusing on sleep, nutrition, and movement.

*   **8 hours of sleep**
*   **3 clean meals**
*   **10,000 steps**

#### Reflective Question

Favourite Question of the week: **How do I want to feel in the evening?** My answer: I want to feel relaxed, rested, and accomplished.

### Book Recommendation

Check out this book: [Rest: Why You Get More Done When You Work Less](https://www.amazon.com/Rest-Why-More-Done-Work/dp/0465074871)
