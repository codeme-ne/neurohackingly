**My favourite Quotes:**

> “Steve Jobs gave a small private presentation about the iTunes Music Store to some independent record label people. My favorite line of the day was when people kept raising their hand saying, "Does it do \[x\]?", "Do you plan to add \[y\]?". Finally Jobs said, "Wait wait — put your hands down. Listen: I know you have a thousand ideas for all the cool features iTunes could have. So do we. But we don't want a thousand features. That would be ugly. Innovation is not about saying yes to everything. It's about saying NO to all but the most crucial features.”  
> ― Derek Sivers

> \- Tony Robbins

> "If you want to love what you do, abandon the passion mindset (“what can the world offer me?”) and instead adopt the craftsman mindset (“what can I offer the world?”)."  
> \- Cal Newport

> "Anxiety is experiencing failure in advance."  
> \- Seth Godin

> "There are two mistakes one can make along the road to truth.   Not going all the way, and not starting.”   Siddhrtha Gautama"

> "What we fear doing most is usually what we most need to do."  
> \- Tim Ferriss

> "People will choose unhappiness over uncertainty."  
> \- Tim Ferriss

> "The question you should be asking isn't, "What do I want?" or "What are my goals?" but "What would excite me?  
> \- Tim Ferriss

> "The values of the world we inhabit and the people we surround ourselves with have a profound effect on who we are."
