👋 Hello Friend

Over the past six months, I've been deeply engaged in accountability coaching to focus on and execute truly important tasks.

Now, as a productivity coach myself, I want to share my top three insights from this transformative journey.

## ❇️My Top 3 Insights from Six Months of Productivity Coaching

#### **🩷#1. Reflect on Your Wins Every Week**

Each week, ask yourself: What was my biggest win?

Recognizing your successes helps to identify what’s working well, allowing you to double down and increase your chances of continued success.

#### **👌#2. Embrace Imperfection**

Limiting beliefs and perfectionism can hinder our progress towards significant outcomes.

Commit to consistently producing work that is imperfect yet creative and courageous. Embracing imperfection frees you from the shackles of perfectionism and accelerates your learning of essential information. It helps you to understand what "good" really means and gets you started on your path.

The goal is to keep moving forward and build momentum, gradually leading you closer to understanding what a "perfect" outcome might look like.

#### **🏁#3. Focus on a Strong Finish**

With 16 weeks left in the year, consider how you want to end 2024.

When you reflect back in December, will you feel proud of what you've achieved, or will there be a sense of regret over what was left undone? Focus on setting yourself up for a strong finish.

Revisit your goals, tighten your timelines, and ensure you're moving forward with purpose.

Have a great week!

xx Lukas 🌞

I’m currently replicating Bryan Johnson's supplement routine with personalized alternatives. Did I manage to make it more affordable?

Hit like to let me know if you’d like more content on this! 👍

![In the image, there is a wooden surface with a variety of supplements and health-related products neatly arranged. On the left, there’s a large blue bag labeled "Blueprint Bryan Johnson" and some other smaller bags. In the middle, there are containers labeled "Amino Fuel" and other supplements like powdered products. On the right, there is a cluster of various supplement bottles, including several from brands like NOW and Nu U Nutrition. Some bottles have dropper lids, indicating they are liquid supplements or tinctures. Also, there’s a small black device in the middle, which appears to be a scale or measuring tool.  The products seem to be part of a detailed supplement routine, possibly inspired by Bryan Johnson's Blueprint regimen.](/images/top-3-insights-from-six-months-of-productivity-coaching/C58C7D70-8556-4E7C-8716-5CA433FFDBC9-1.jpeg)
