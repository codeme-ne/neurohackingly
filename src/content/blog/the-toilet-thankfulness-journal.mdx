👋 Hello friend

**I have been keeping a Toilet Thankfulness Journal, aka. Gratitude Journal for 4 months now and already have over 200 entries.** In this newsletter edition, I will show you how to never forget to be grateful again.

You hear about the great benefits of keeping a gratitude journal, buy the best new book with the right pen, and you are disciplined and enthusiastic in the first few days. But day by day, it becomes less and less until you finally forget that you have a gratitude journal.

> "Gratitude drives happiness. Happiness boosts productivity. Productivity reveals mastery. And mastery inspires the world." - Robin Sharma

### 😊 The 3-Step Process on How to Never Forget to Be Grateful Again (while reducing smartphone screentime)

Step 1: Take any book.

Any Book

Step 2: Take any pen.

Any Pen

Step 3: Place the book and the pen next to the toilet.

### 📒 The author James Clear of the bestseller Atomic Habits mentions [4 ways to create a good habit.](https://jamesclear.com/atomic-habits-summary)

1.  Make it **obvious**. 🧐
2.  Make it **attractive**. 😍
3.  Make it **easy**. 🤭
4.  Make it **satisfying**. 😌

Regarding rules 1 and 3, "make it obvious" and "make it easy," I don't lock the Gratitude Journal away in some cupboard or on a shelf.

Sitting on the toilet, **the Gratitude Journal should be easily reachable** to take it and write down 2-3 things you are grateful for.

**Eventually, you'll be so proud that you don't want to break your streak of gratitude entries** (like me - over 200 entries 😉). When your roommates don't abuse your book as they did for gratitude entry number 129 or 130 or party guests complain about your handwriting, you can use the book to reflect on a few little things that brought you joy today.

**In the past, my first intuition on the toilet was to reach into my pocket and check Instagram.** Now, I have a no phone policy when doing business in the morning, and I have successfully replaced scrolling with writing down things I am grateful for.

Another option is to hang a white poster beside your bed where you can write down things you are grateful for before bed or after getting up.
