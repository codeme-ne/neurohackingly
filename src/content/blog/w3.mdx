Hello Friend,

## My Top 3 Discoveries This Week (May 12-18, 2025):

### #1. I tried Bryan Johnson's workout w/ Dr. Andy Galpin. 💪

His warm-up of day 1 & 2 was my workout.

This program is different. It's not only about building muscles. It's about balance, strength, posture, speed, power, conditioning, core rotation, and tissue resilience.

It includes rhythm and cognitive elements. I never thought about rhythm during workouts before.

### #2. My AI course which is all about how to be more productive with AI starts tomorrow. 🤖

As a recap I read Google expert [Lee Boonstra's Prompt Engineering](/content/files/2025/05/Prompt-Engineering-by-Lee-Boonstra.pdf) Handbook.

**Want to go deeper?** Check out [Foundations of Large Language Models](/content/files/2025/05/Foundations-of-Large-Language-Models-by-Tong-Xiao-and-Jingbo-Zhu.pdf) by Tong Xiao and Jingbo Zhu.

### #3. The Right-Click Prompt extension lets you store and organize all your AI prompts in your browser. 💻

I used to use [Beeftext](https://beeftext.org/) as a keyboard shortcut tool for Windows. I am currently trying the Chrome extension [Right-Click Prompt](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/rcp-right-click-prompt-ai/pdhaalepogdcfdkbhgphjppjcmjbjfkd) and I am really happy with it.

Until next week,  
Lukas
