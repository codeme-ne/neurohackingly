### 🤬 Day 1: Master Your Emotional Patterns

The goal is to live in a beautiful state as much as possible.

Tony Robbins made a contract with himself. He does not allow himself to spend more than 2 minutes at a time in a bad state. (e.g. suffering, worrying or feeling frustrated)

I have a note marked as favourite (from Unleadh the Power Within November 2022) about why I must live in a beautiful state no matter what.

In this beautiful state, you have access to all your most powerful resources, make better choices and take action.

#### Exercise of Day 1

1.  Write down all negative emotions you regularly feel in a week.
2.  Choose the 2 most uncomfortable emotions.
3.  Write down which positive emotions you want to feel instead.

Over time, you will notice when one of the two most uncomfortable emotions come up.

💡

Tip: You can train your emotions like a muscle. The more you experience beautiful states, the bigger the muscle becomes.

* * *

### 🤺 Day 2: Master Your Physical Life

Look at how satisfied you are with your health and where you want to go.

Tony himself recommends doing one hour of exercise a day.

Scientific evidence of the interconnection between physical and mental health can be found in my favourite book about exercise and brain fitness, [Spark](https://amzn.to/3VE5dhv).

* * *

### 💏 Day 3: Master Your Relationships

Relationships are essential to your well-being and influence your character, beliefs, and values.

Here are some questions you can ask yourself (from the [Inner Circle](https://tr.tonyrobbins.com/inner-circle56422742) Relationship Program)

#### Exercise of Day 3

1.  What should my ideal relationship be like? (not the other person)
2.  What would it take to close the gap between where I am now and where I want to be?
3.  What could I do? What's keeping me? What needs to change?

### 💸 Day 4: Master Your Financial Life

Financial stress leads to negative emotions.

Tony recommends these 3 steps to take control of your finances.

#### Exercise of Day 4

1.  Make a list of all beliefs you have about money. Is there one that is holding you back? Also, reading books like Napoleon Hill's [Think and grow rich](https://amzn.to/3iFlkwJ) will change your focus.
2.  Create a system that automatically invests a portion of your salary (e.g., 10%) in ETFs.

3\. As a third point, Tony recommends working with a coach to create a financial plan.

* * *

### 🤹‍♂️ Day 5: Master your behavior

Write a contract to promise that you will live by your beliefs daily.

It can look like this:

_I, (name), will do (behavior) at (time) for (minutes/hours). I do this because (purpose)._

_Date/Place and Signature:_

You can also use apps like [Beeminder](https://www.beeminder.com/) to hold yourself accountable.

#### Exercise of Day 5

1.  Write a list of 7-10 emotional feelings you want to live by daily.
2.  How will you achieve this?
3.  How do you know that you have reached it?

* * *

### ⏲ Day 6: Master Your Time

Tony Robbins says that you can control the perception of time and work it to your advantage.

[Read more](/10-powerful-questions-time-of-your-life/) on the Rapid Planning Method.

#### Exercise of Day 6

1.  Practice consciously directing your focus on the future, present or past. This will make your brain realize that you are in control.
2.  Make a list of things that will positively impact your life. Urgent things come later.
3.  Execute

* * *

### 🛌 Day 7: Rest

To let what you have learned sink in, you should relax on the seventh day.

#### Tony Robbins recommends doing one of two things:

1\. Make a plan of what fun things you will do.

2\. Do something spontaneous that you enjoy. What gives you energy?
