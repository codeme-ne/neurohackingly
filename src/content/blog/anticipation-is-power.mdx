👋 Hello friend

This week's newsletter will be a **short but spicy one.** 🌶

🍅

Post of the week: ➡ [How to overcome Procrastination with this Simple Trick](/how-to-overcome-procrastination-with-this-simple-trick/)

### An impressive thing about aviation is its focus on learning from past experiences and applying the findings to anticipate the future.

Technical: There's always one or more backup systems when the main component fails.

Human: In pilot school, trainees repeatedly simulate possible worst-case scenarios.

Why? To not freeze when a similar scenario happens in real life, but having a plan and executing on it. ⬆ **Mental capacity ⬇ Narrow focus**

## ❗ What if we had a procedure, checklist, and step-by-step plan for the challenges we frequently face in our lives?

Some people may say that they rather continue thinking positively. What you concentrate on, you will get. And I agree.

**However, with the power of anticipation, I am learning to better deal with setbacks and constantly look for possible solutions.**

Like NLP Trainer and psychologist, Marian Zefferer said in this week's interview:

> It's not what happens to you that matters, but how you react to it.

**The podcast episode will be released this week.**

🍦 Have a great week!

xx Lukas
