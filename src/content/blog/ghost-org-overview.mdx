## 🔍 What is Ghost?

If you want to start a blog, you probably want to focus on the actual content production.

You'll need a **fast, reliable, and nicely designed website.** I want to introduce you to Ghost, an open-source platform written in Javascript. Just to make it clear, they do not sponsor me; they don't even know that I write this post. I genuinely **love this Creator Platform.**

Ghost is a [Content Management System](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content-Management-System) that consists of a front-end user interface that allows the user (without touching any code) to modify the webpage.

## ⚡ Core features of Ghost CMS

*   integrated **newsletter**
*   **paid and free membership subscription**, can use it like Patreon and get payouts via stripe
*   has **integrations** like Zapier or Google Analytics
*   **Markdown** so you can maintain your writing flow
*   creates **SEO-friendly** URLs
*   can insert custom **HTML and CSS** into a page
*   allows your readers to **search** across all published posts, keywords, and authors

## ☁ Hosting, not Ghosting

You can let ghost.org host you or self-host your site.

If you are running a self-hosted instance, Ghost recommends [Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com/) with at least 1GB to run Ghost. I decided to go with the ghost plan because it is the most convenient for me.

With Ghost Pro, you have Email support 24/7.

[Hosting](https://ghost.org/docs/hosting/)

I chose the creator plan, with the possibility to get custom integrations, like [Zapier](https://zapier.com/) and [GitHub](https://github.com/). Custom Themes like [mine from Ali Abdaal](https://ghost.org/themes/ali-abdaal/) are, too, only available with the Creator Package.

## 🌅 Conclusion

Ghost has an **aesthetic design, runs super fast and smooth,** and I like its **built-in newsletter.**

It is preferential to have little coding experience when starting with Ghost. If not, at least a little courage to read into the documents from Ghost.
