# Atomic Essay Day 1: Why I'm Starting To Write Online (Again)

I recently signed up for Dickie Bush & Nicolas Cole's cohort-based course, Ship 30 for 30.

## Here are a few reasons why:

1.  I want to start into 2024 with a challenge. Like taking a cold shower as the first thing of the day, everything else will feel easy afterward. 
2.  Writing = Clarity -> Power
3.  One of the proudest and best experiences in 2022 was attending Ship30.

Over the next 30 days, I plan on writing about mental health, physical wellbeing and self-coaching.

Join me on this adventure—and let me know if you have any questions along the way!

I'm excited to start sharing what I know online. (again)

# Atomic Essay Day 2: 3 Topics I Am Exploring In My Life Right Now

![](/images/30-atomic-essays-in-30-days-january-edition/preview-image-5WKYQcASET6IptRZNJT3znrQGNhAY8.png)

There are 3 topics I am actively thinking about a lot these days:

## Topic #1: Personal Energy Management

I am interested in Energy Management because I noticed that I only have a certain amount of energy a day. I want to make the best possible use of this resource.

And I hope that over the next 3 years, as I continue to learn more and more, I'll be able to be in balance throughout the day.

## Topic #2: Self-Reflection with Self-made Notion Templates

I first got interested in Self-Reflection with Self-made Notion Templates a few years ago.

Ali Abdaal introduced me to it—and since then, I have learned a lot about the importance of reflecting in the morning and evening, having preformulated questions, and using past entries to optimize my life.

## Topic #3: Automation of Daily Life Processes (Digital and Physical)

I also have an interest in learning more about the automation of daily life processes (digital and physical)

It's one of those fun rabbit holes I find myself exploring simply because I enjoy it.

It would be great to connect with other people who are interested in these same topics—so if any of the above resonates, feel free to reach out!

# Atomic Essay Day 3: The Best Way To Get Started Learning About Journaling

![](/images/30-atomic-essays-in-30-days-january-edition/preview-image-IlRbpeZPy8HiCct79RzAgOqG3BgaYw.png)

I love learning about Journaling.

Unfortunately, when I first got interested in Journaling I had a hard time figuring out where to start.

## So, if you are trying to learn more about Journaling here's the best way to get started:

*   **📘 Read This Book:** [The Artist's Way](https://juliacameronlive.com/books-by-julia/the-artists-way-a-spiritual-path-to-higher-creativity-audiobook/) by Julia Cameron. It will give you a lay of the land and is a helpful way to get your bearings. Check out the [article on Shortform - my favourite book summary app](/shortform-my-favorite-app-for-book-summaries/).
*   **🎬 Watch This YouTube Video:** [How to Use Writing To Sharpen Your Thinking](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65U5byDZ55M) by Tim Ferriss is a must-watch beginner resource for anyone interested in Journaling.
*   **🎧 Listen To This Podcast:** And if you really want to start going down the rabbit hole, listen to [A Science-Supported Journal Protocol to Improve Mental and Physical Health](https://www.hubermanlab.com/episode/a-science-supported-journaling-protocol-to-improve-mental-physical-health) by Andrew Huberman.

These 3 resources will exponentially accelerate your learning process.
