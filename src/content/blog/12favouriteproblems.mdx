👋🏼 Hello friend,

Last week I started an online course called Building A Second Brain. It's a 4 week course that teaches you how to build a note-taking system using an app of your choice. It consists of the steps **Capture, Organize, Distill and Express**. More on it in my Blogpost this week. The Second Brain is to help us complete projects. For example, if I want to start a project "Make a video" I can just look into my note system and filter all the notes that are relevant. - a very simplified explanation of what the course is about.

## 🖋 First Week - Capture

In the first week, we learned how to capture notes properly. But, how do you know what's worth capturing you may ask? Good question ... 🧐  
Unlike the majority of society, Scientist Richard Feynman **used his problems as a driver to discover a meaning in life and focus his thoughts on how to solve them.** Now known as diffuse mode, without actively thinking, your subconsciousness works on these problems. Feynman always had 12 problem questions with him.

❓ They are open-ended and could look somehow like this:

*   What can I do to be more creative, intelligent, open-minded and just expand the capacity and idea generation and especially analytic capability of my brain?
*   How can I become healthier and happier?
*   How can I give myself the same appreciation I have when someone else compliments me, for loving myself?

✍🏼 Now it's your turn. If you want, you can write down your 12 favourite problems and let your subconscious work on them.

Have fun and a great week!

xx Lukas
