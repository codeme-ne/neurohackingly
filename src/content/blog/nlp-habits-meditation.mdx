## 🎙 #1. [Podcast Interview](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6WwxTdeOPua7AoF376nrKq?si=3b9006595daf4f9f): Mastering problems and negative emotions with NLP teaching coach and psychologist Marian Zefferer.

The 3-step process of how Marian masters problems and negative emotions

#1. Admit Emotions: Admit the emotions you are feeling right now. Pushing it away only makes the monster bigger.

#2. Questioning Techniques: Make a list of the best questions to have at hand when you are caught up in a problem.

#3. Letting the mind wander: Let the questions work on you and do something completely different. (e.g., go for a run, go for a walk).

🎀 More in **[this week's podcast episode.](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6WwxTdeOPua7AoF376nrKq?si=3b9006595daf4f9f)** (English transcription of the episode will follow next week.)

## 🎮 #2. [Habitica](https://habitica.com/static/home): my new favorite app to build habits quickly and playfully

I can't believe it is that easy.

Thanks to this app, I established several good habits and gave up bad ones in no time.

### My daily habit list:

❌ No caffeine after 4 a.m.  
❌ No consumption of artificial sugar

✅ Meditate for at least 15 minutes  
✅ 30 minutes of exercise  
✅ fast for 16h & eat for 8 hours  
✅ 2 minutes of a cold shower in the morning

Habitica treats your life like a game. There are rewards and punishments as motivation. You can even network and challenge yourself together.

💌 Send me a request; my name is habiticoco.

## 🧘 #3. Vipassana Meditation: S. N. Goenka explains [What is Vipassana](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLPJVlVRVmhc4Z01fD57jbzycm9I6W054x) in 10 episodes

When walking to the train or the gym, I use the NET (No extra time) to listen to S. N. Goenka's 10 x 1-hour videos about Vipassana Meditation.

### My takeaways so far:

*   With short daily meditation, we are only scratching the surface of what meditation can do for us
*   There is a HUGE difference between intellectually understanding meditation and actually experiencing it.

> Knowledge is potential power. Action is power. - Tony Robbins

*   Mastery: experiencing sensations as an observer without reacting to pleasure or pain

I have already done a [podcast episode](/podcast/the-power-of-meditation-better-attention-and-concentration/) on the power of meditation. Also, [Tim Ferris](https://tim.blog/podcast/), after hundreds of interviews with the most successful CEOs, athletes, artists etc. says that they all have the following 2 habits:

1.  journal
2.  meditate

## 💎 #4. [Study tips](/studying/): From the learning treasure chest, new learning techniques reflected from my everyday life

#1. What we often forget: Learning should be fun. That's why I ask myself the question before every learning session: how can I make this fun and enjoyable?

#2. When learning individual details, try to zoom out and see the "big picture." Where in the big picture does what you've learned fit?

#3. The cramped hammering of knowledge doesn't help. When I am in a relaxed posture and remember to breathe, I can process and absorb information much better. This is a personal reminder for me. 😂

#4. Listening and comprehending what the teacher is saying can make us think we understand what is being said. But to check if we really understand it, we need to answer questions or explain it to a friend.

#5. Do your own thing and don't look at others; it sometimes seems that others can remember and understand everything. However, you don't know how much time they have invested beforehand.

#6. Blog article by Ali Abdaal: [Make a Spaced Repetition Timetabl](https://aliabdaal.com/spaced-repetition/)e to know what you should study today.

#7. When do you need what you are learning? What will the situation look like when you need to recall your knowledge? Knowing something and actually being able to recall knowledge in a future moment is like night and day.
