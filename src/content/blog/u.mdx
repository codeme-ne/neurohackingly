Derek Sivers has a new book: [Useful Not True](https://sive.rs/u).

90 pages, about reframing. Packed with brilliant thought experiments.

# MY THREE FAVOURITE CHAPTERS:

(not in chronological order)

## 1\. From Explorer to Self-Leader

We have two roles in our lives:

*   Role #1: The Explorer - He tries out different things and constantly consumes new information.
*   Role #2: The Self-Leader - He makes a decision and sticks to it.

There is a point when the Self-Leader must take over. 🧭 **→** 🧑‍✈️

> "Stop considering other viewpoints. Stop changing the course. Pick a destination and cut off other options."

When the Explorer tries to take control again, remember:

> "People who tell me they are lost and running in circles have one thing in common: They say they keep listening to podcasts, reading books, watching videos, doing courses — taking in more and more information — and still don't know what to do."

My inner Explorer shows up on time every week, when I create a new module for my 12-week productivity course.

He's a distraction. What he says is neither useful nor true.

I say out loud "Self-Leader has control." and hand over the stick to the Self-Leader.

The Self-Leader takes over control.

## 2\. No new instructions for the computer

(Different example, same concept)

ChatGPT is generating an answer. Before it's finished, you feed it new information. What happens?

It stops and must reconsider the answer based on the new information.

> "Run the program. Stop interrupting yourself with new information. Let yourself execute one plan of action, and see it through to fruition."

## 3\. Private journal to internalize it

> "Come back and review your journal often, so you can remind yourself of your decision, reasons, vision, and plan."

Journal to mitigate challenges. Journal to outsmart your future self.

I was inspired, so I booked a cabin in the woods for 3 days.

No phone. No distractions.

Just me. My thoughts. And a journal.

# START WITH YOUR PERSPECTIVE:

What if we switched from asking "Is this true?"

to "Is this useful for me right now?"

I can recommend Derek Sivers' book "Useful Not True" from the bottom of my heart.

**What perspective could be useful for you right now, whether or not it's "true"?**

Have a lovely week,
