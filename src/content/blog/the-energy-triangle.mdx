👋 Hello friend,

Have you ever been struggling with time management? This year I juggled a few things at the same time. How? That's what I want to show you today.

I want to introduce you to a model I've been working on. I call it: **The Energy Triangle.**

When feeling depressed, sad or other negative emotions I look at The Energy Triangle. It is simple but very powerful. It consists of these **3 simple things**:

🥗 Eat/Drink

🛌 Sleep

🏃‍♂️ Exercise

Most of the time it is **one or more of the 3 things I have neglected when feeling down.** Now, you may be thinking: "Well, that's obvious to me, Lukas. Nothing new."

> But aren't the most basic things, the things we forget most often?

There are all kinds of remedies being advertised these days.  
"Have you tried the latest supplement? Try out this new time management strategy, where you double the amount of work in half the time!

None of that does me any good if I don't have **my energy management in check.**

Does your Energy Triangle involve any other factors? Let me know.

Have an amazing week.

xx Lukas

# ✍🏻 Quote of the week:

> People think focus means saying yes to the thing you’ve got to focus on. But that’s not what it means at all. It means saying no to the hundred other good ideas that there are. You have to pick carefully. I’m actually as proud of the things we haven’t done as the things I have done. Innovation is saying ‘no’ to 1,000 things.
