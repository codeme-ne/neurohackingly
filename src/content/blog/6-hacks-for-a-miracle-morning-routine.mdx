Today I will share my miracle morning routine with you.

Establishing a proper morning routine (including these 6 hacks) will **set you up for the day**. You have laid the foundation to build upon and will notice more energy, motivation, and ease through the day.

I have been perfecting my morning routine for years by following people like [Ali Abdaal](https://aliabdaal.com/how-i-plan-my-day/) and [Dr. Huberman](https://hubermanlab.com/).

## 🌞Here are my 6 hacks for a miracle morning routine to get more energy and ease:

### #1. I have enabled the sleep mode on my phone that engages from 22:30 to 07:00.

It turns the phone screen to black and white and disables all notifications.

It hinders me from looking at the phone before bed and first thing in the morning.

### #2. I go outside to let light shine into my eyes and let my body feel today's temperature.

Studies [like this one](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6751071/) show that light in the morning improves sleep, mood, and general well-being.

Within the first 30 minutes of waking up I open my curtains and let fresh air inside my room. Then I go onto my balcony (without socks, to "ground" myself) and let my inner cycradian clock know that it's daytime.

### #3. I ask myself the following 3 questions to prime myself for the day.

one: Should I focus on what's missing or what I have?

two: Should I focus on what I [can't or can control today](https://www.tonyrobbins.com/stories/business-mastery/from-taking-care-to-taking-control/)?

three: Should I focus on the past, the future, or the present?

### #4. I drink half a litre of water to compensate for water I lost while sleeping (+ a little bit of salt) and avoid coffee in the first two hours after waking up.

Neuroscientist and podcaster Dr. Andrew Huberman recommends delaying coffee intake by 90 to 120 minutes after waking up.

The reason behind this theory is to avoid a caffeine crash in the afternoon. If you want to know the science behind this phenomenon [listen to the 3-minute snip.](https://podclips.com/c/why-andrew-huberman-avoids-caffeine-for-152-hours-after-waking)

### #5. I take a cold shower for 2 minutes.

I take a cold shower to have accomplished a difficult task first thing in the morning.

Things that will come up during the day will have less of an effect because I did this challenging task already. I usually set a timer for 2 minutes. (more than that is not beneficial for health, according to [peakwolf](https://www.peakwolf.ch/) – but it of course depends on the temperature).

### #6. I either do the Tony Robbins Priming or practice Meditation.

I wrote a [whole blog post](/4-step-process-tony-robbins-does-every-morning/) on priming like Tony Robbins.

If you want to know more about Vipassana, I recommend reading or listening to [this book](https://amzn.to/3IoADol). It teaches the fundamentals on Vipassana and the mindset of S. N. Goenka.

### #7. (bonus) Here are some other quotes I got while listening to this [great podcast episode](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwjnG45zO5U) with Tony Robbins and Jay Shetty.

> There are two pains in life: The pain of discipline and the pain of regret.

> Problems are challenges to be solved.

> Let disappointment defeat or drive you.

> What you focus on, you will get. Don't let fear drive you.

> I will feed my mind and strengthen my body.

### Bonus

1\. I try to not look at my phone the first few hours of the day, to have clear and empowering thoughts.

2\. I try to do some kind of exercise, just for a couple of minutes to boost bloodflow to the brain.

3\. I try to keep unimportant decisions to a minimum as too many decisions will create decision fatigue. This is why we are so tired after going shopping without a premade shopping list. At least I am. ☺️
