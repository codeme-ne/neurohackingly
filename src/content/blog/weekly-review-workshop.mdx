👋 Hello friend

The last few weeks I attended the Weekly Review Workshop hosted by Ali Abdaal. The Weekly Review is the cornerstone of every good Productivity System.

I will share with you the 5 questions of the weekly review.

### Taking Action

1.  Take out a pen and paper or open a new Google doc.
2.  Put on some inspiring music, like [Lord of the Rings | The Shire - Music & Ambience](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30b7_S0paCQ).
3.  Get out a cup of green tea or yerba mate. 🍵

## Answer 5 questions. Take 3 minutes each.

_\->_ [_3 minutes timer_](https://vclock.com/set-timer-for-3-minutes/) ⏲️

#### 🥅 What are your **top 3-5 goals of the year**?

*   I have one goal for wealth, one for health and one for relationships.
*   _Example:_
    *   Health: Have constant Energy throughout the day, with a feeling of relaxation and easy in the evening.
    *   Wealth: Have a coaching business with 100 mio. ARR
    *   Relationships: A close circle of family and friends who support each other and where you can realize your full potential.

#### 🎉 Review the **previous week's accomplishments**.

I write down in keywords what I did last week. First I think about which pictures and nice moments come to my mind.

If I can't think of any more, I go to the weekly view in google calendar and see what happened.

Typical Week

#### 🏔️ What were **last week's challenges**? In what way did you not act in line with your best self? What would you like to change (if anything) next week?

Here i usually look at last week's reflection and see if i was able to implement last week's challenges this week. then i look at last week's challenges.

#### 🗓️ Create **calendar blocks** for things you want to get done or things you want to take time for. (Maybe a gym block? Work? Meeting friends?

I open the 2 week view on google calendar and see what major events are going to happen. Then, with a focus on action and not perfectionism, I enter the calendar blocks that come to mind.

2 weeks view costumized

e.g. I have a university presentation next Saturday?

2 hours blocker on Wednesday from 09.00 - 11.00 to "do presentation uni"

#### 🚀 Choose your **Top 3 outcomes for the upcoming week** - if the week ahead was great, what would be the top 3 things you'd accomplish?

a. **Schedule** time in your **calendar** to work towards these outcomes.

For me, it's always one outcome in health, one in wealth and one in relationships. That way, I achieve a good balance in my life.

### Studies done on Weekly Reviews:

**Meta-Analysis on Time Management**: A meta-analysis published in _PLOS ONE_ examined the effectiveness of time management strategies, including weekly reviews. The study found that regular time management practices significantly enhance job performance, academic achievement, and overall well-being. Weekly reviews help individuals reflect on their progress, identify obstacles, and adjust their plans, which collectively improve productivity and reduce procrastination​ ([PLOS](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0245066))​.

**Practical Implementation and Benefits**: Another source from Lark highlighted the practical steps and benefits of conducting weekly reviews. By setting aside dedicated time each week to reflect on past achievements and challenges, individuals can prioritize tasks and align their weekly activities with long-term goals. This practice fosters better decision-making and reduces the likelihood of procrastination by maintaining a clear focus on objectives​ ([Lark](https://www.larksuite.com/en_us/topics/productivity-glossary/weekly-review))​.

**Impact on Mental Health and Productivity:** Research has shown that regular weekly reviews can significantly reduce anxiety and improve mental well-being. A study highlighted by _Martine Ellis_ explains that the weekly review process helps individuals manage their workload more effectively, thereby reducing stress related to uncompleted tasks and future uncertainties. The consistent practice of weekly reviews keeps long-term goals visible and ensures continuous progress, which contributes to a sense of control and accomplishment (Martine Ellis)​ ([martineellis.com](https://www.martineellis.com/blog/weekly-review))​.
