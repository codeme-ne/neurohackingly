Ever feel like you're drowning in complex tasks with no roadmap?n

I've been there. Until I discovered these two game-changers.

## Problem #1: "I know WHAT I want, but not HOW to get there"

**Solution: Gemini's Checklist Superpower 💎**

Last month, [my AI course](https://www.produktiv.me/ki/) sold out in 72 hours. But setting it up? A nightmare.

□ Registration forms  
□ Payment processing  
□ Course access system

So I did what I always do when things get complicated.

I sketched it out.

A rough workflow in Figjam

Then I prompted gemini:

> Create a detailed checklist of what I need to do to follow the workflow described in the diagram. Fill any gaps or things I may have missed. Keep it as simple, but also as detailed as possible. Write out every single step. Describe it like I don't have any tech experience.

Prompt Gemini for checklist → Export to Google Docs → Enjoy the satisfaction of checking off boxes

17 happy participants. Zero tech headaches.

## Problem #2: "Creating presentations takes so long"

**Solution: Claude as Your Writing, Design and Tech Team ✴️**

Prezi wants $180/year. Claude Pro does it better.

I love Prezi's interactive storylines.

I did the following:

1.  Searched for Prezi presentation I liked
2.  Took some screenshots of slides
3.  Recorded a voice memo of the context I need the presentation for
4.  Asked to create a 40 slide presentation in HTML, CSS & JavaScript

That's how I turned a boring presentation into a premium desert island experience 😄

One prompt = 80% done.

There is even a treasure map in the upper right corner that you can fold out to see where you are.

It even made a workbook.

Time saved: 8 hours.

What's the ONE task you'd love to delegate to AI this week?

Have a great week,
